To address this question, we studied olfaction in honeybees Apis mellifera using the olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response. We conditioned bees to odours and tested generalisation responses to different odours. Sixteen odours were used, which varied both in their functional group (primary and secondary alcohols, aldehydes and ketones) and in their carbon-chain length (from six to nine carbons).The results obtained by presentation of a total of 16 \u00d7 16 odour pairs show that (i) all odorants presented could be learned, although acquisition was lower for short-chain ketones; (ii) generalisation varied depending both on the functional group and the carbon-chain length of odours trained; higher generalisation was found between long-chain than between short-chain molecules and between groups such as primary and secondary alcohols; (iii) for some odour pairs, cross-generalisation between odorants was asymmetric; (iv) a putative olfactory space could be defined for the honeybee with functional group and carbon-chain length as inner dimensions; (v) perceptual distances in such a space correlate well with physiological distances determined from optophysiological recordings of antennal lobe activity. We conclude that functional group and carbon-chain length are inner dimensions of the honeybee olfactory space and that neural activity in the antennal lobe reflects the perceptual quality of odours.\n\nTraining thousands of bees uncovers the chemical characteristics they use to discriminate between odours and reveals how the perception of odour correlates with specific neural activity in their brain\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nStimulus discrimination and generalisation constitute two major abilities exhibited by most living animals. Discrimination allows treating different signals as distinct, while generalisation allows treating different but similar stimuli as equivalents [1,2,3]. Similarity along one or several perceptual dimensions determines the degree of generalisation between stimuli [2]. Determining such dimensions is fundamental for defining an animal's perceptual space. This objective remains, however, elusive in the case of the olfactory modality in which the dimensions along which odours are evaluated are not well known. Characteristics such as the functional chemical group or the carbon-chain length of a chemical substance may influence olfactory perception. It is known that at least some features of odorant molecules influence olfactory perception. For instance, some enantiomers can be discriminated by humans and nonhuman primates [4]. If and how chemical group and carbon-chain length are integrated as inner dimensions into an olfactory perceptual space remains unknown.\n\nVertebrate and invertebrate nervous systems show important functional as well as anatomical similarities in the way in which olfactory signals are detected and processed in their brains, particularly at the level of their first olfactory centres, the olfactory bulb in the case of vertebrates and the antennal lobe (AL) in the case of insects [5,6,7]. Insects are useful models for studying olfaction, as their behaviour heavily relies on the use of olfactory cues. The honeybee Apis mellifera is one such model in which behavioural and neurobiological studies have been performed to unravel the basis of olfaction [8,9,10,11]. Honeybee foragers are \u2018flower constant' and learn and memorise a given floral species that they exploit at a time as long as it is profitable. Floral cues, among which odours play a prominent role, are then associated with nectar or pollen reward [12,13]. However, under natural conditions, the blends of volatiles emitted by floral sources vary widely in quantity and quality both in time and in space [14,15]. To cope with such changes in an efficient way, a \u2018flower constant' forager should be able to generalise its choice to the same kind of floral sources despite fluctuations in their volatile emissions.\n\nIn a pioneering investigation, von Frisch [16] trained freely flying bees to visit an artificial feeder presenting several essential oils (odour mixtures). Using a set of 32 odour mixtures, von Frisch observed that after learning that a blend was associated with sucrose solution, bees tended to prefer this odour blend, but they sometimes visited other blends that were similar (to the human nose) to the rewarded one. Olfactory generalisation in honeybees was mainly studied on restrained honeybees using the conditioning of the proboscis extension reflex (PER) [17,18]. In this paradigm, harnessed honeybees are conditioned to odours associated with a sucrose reward. When the antennae of a hungry bee are touched with sucrose solution, the animal reflexively extends its proboscis to reach out towards and to lick the sucrose. Odours presented to the antennae do not usually release such a reflex in naive animals. If an odour is presented immediately before sucrose solution (forward pairing), an association is formed and the odour will subsequently trigger the PER in a subsequent unrewarded test. This effect is clearly associative and involves classical conditioning [18]. Thus, the odour can be viewed as the conditioned stimulus (CS), and sucrose solution as an appetitive unconditioned stimulus (US). Bees conditioned to individual odours or to olfactory mixtures can generalise PER to a wide range of different olfactory stimuli. Using the PER paradigm, Vareschi [19] showed that bees generalise most often between odours with similar carbon-chain lengths and between odours belonging to the same functional group. However, Vareschi conditioned odours in a differential way, with two rewarded and many unrewarded odours, so that several generalisation gradients (excitatory and inhibitory) may have interacted in an unknown way to determine the generalisation responses exhibited by the bees [19]. Using a similar approach and a restricted (6 \u00d7 6) set of odour combinations, Smith and Menzel [20] confirmed that bees generalise among odours with the same functional group, but their analysis did not detail the results obtained with individual odour combinations, thus rendering impossible the analysis of generalisation between odours with similar carbon-chain lengths. Free-flying bees trained in a differential way to a rewarded odour presented simultaneously with multiple unrewarded odours also generalise between odours with similar functional groups [21]. As for Vareschi's study [19], such an experimental design makes it difficult to interpret the generalisation responses due to unknown interactions between excitatory and inhibitory generalisation gradients.\n\nRecently, optical imaging studies facilitated our understanding of how olfactory stimuli are detected and processed in the bee brain [22,23,24,25,26]. The first relay of the bee's olfactory system involves the ALs, which receive sensory input from the olfactory receptor neurons of the antennae within a number of 160 functional units, the glomeruli [27,28,29]. Within each glomerulus, synaptic contacts are formed with local interneurons and projection neurons (PNs). PNs send processed information from the ALs to higher brain centres such as the mushroom bodies and the lateral protocerebrum [30]. Stimulation with an odour leads to a specific spatiotemporal pattern of activated glomeruli, as shown, using in vivo calcium imaging techniques that employ fluorescent dyes to measure intracellular calcium in active neurons [22,24,31]. The odour-evoked activity patterns are conserved between individuals and constitute therefore a code [23,24]. Odours with similar chemical structures tend to present similar glomerular activity patterns [23]. Furthermore, it is believed that the neural code of odour-evoked glomerular patterns measured in the bee brain actually represent the perceptual code, although this idea was never tested directly.\n\nIn the present work, we studied behavioural olfactory generalisation, using the PER conditioning paradigm, with 16 odorants varying in two chemical features, functional group and chain length. The odours belonged to four chemical categories: alcohols with the functional group on the first or second carbon of the carbon chain (henceforth primary and secondary alcohols, respectively), aldehydes, and ketones. They possessed therefore three functional groups (alcohol, aldehyde, ketone). Their chain length ranged from six to nine carbon atoms (C6, C7, C8, and C9). The pairwise combination of 16 odours defined a 16 \u00d7 16 matrix. These odours are well discriminated by free-flying bees [21] and give consistent odour-evoked signals in optical imaging studies [23]. Using a behavioural approach, we measured similarity between odours and calculated their perceptual distances in a putative olfactory space. These perceptual distances were correlated with physiological distances measured in optical imaging experiments [23]. The correlation between both datasets was highly significant, thus indicating that odours that are encoded as physiologically similar are also perceived as similar by honeybees. Although other studies have addressed the issue of perceptual correlates of neural representations [32,33], we show for the first time that neural olfactory activity corresponds to olfactory perception defined on the basis of specific dimensions in a putative olfactory space, a finding that is of central importance in the study of the neurobiology of perception.\n\nResults\nWe trained 2,048 honeybees along three trials in which one of the 16 odours used in our experiments was paired with a reward of sucrose solution (conditioned odour). Afterwards, each bee was tested with four odours that could include or not include the trained odour.\n\nAcquisition Phase\nThe level of PER in the first conditioning trial was very low (between 0% and 8.60%) for all odours (Figure 1). All the 16 odours were learnt but not with the same efficiency. An overall (trial \u00d7 odour) analysis of variance (ANOVA) showed a significant increase in responses along trials (F\n2, 4064 = 2215.50, p < 0.001) and a significant heterogeneity among odours (F\n15, 2032 = 8.80, p < 0.001). Responses to the CS in the last conditioning trial reached a level of approximately 70% for primary and secondary alcohols, 80% for aldehydes, and 61% for ketones.\n\nFigure 1 Acquisition Curves for Primary Alcohols, Secondary Alcohols, Aldehydes, and Ketones\nThe ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to the training odour (CS). The abscissa indicates the conditioning trials (C1, C2, C3) and the test with the CS (T). The curves correspond to molecules with 6 (white triangles), 7 (white diamonds), 8 (black circles) and 9 carbons (black squares); (n = 128 bees for each curve). As not all 128 bees were tested with the odour used as CS, the sample size in the tests was smaller (n = 32). Different letters (a, b, c) indicate significant differences either between acquisition curves for different chain-length molecules (in the case of the ketones) or between test responses (post hoc Scheff\u00e9 tests).\n\nIn the case of aldehydes and primary and secondary alcohols, no significant chain-length effect within functional groups was found over the whole conditioning procedure (chain length \u00d7 trial ANOVA; chain-length effect for primary alcohols: F\n3, 508 = 0.18, p > 0.05; secondary alcohols: F\n3, 508 = 1.47, p > 0.05; and aldehydes: F\n3, 508 = 1.26, p > 0.05). In contrast, bees conditioned to ketones showed a significant chain-length effect in the acquisition (chain length \u00d7 trial ANOVA; chain-length effect: F\n3, 508 = 20.00, p < 0.005). Scheff\u00e9 post hoc comparisons showed that acquisition was significantly better for nonanone (81.25% responses in the last conditioning trial) than for all other ketones. Octanone (68.75% responses in the last conditioning trial) was also better learned than hexanone and heptanone (45.31% and 48.44% responses in the last conditioning trial, respectively) (Figure 1, bottom right). The effect over trials was significant in all cases (p < 0.05) as bees learned all odours.\n\nThe analysis of acquisition for each chain length separately revealed that it varied significantly depending on the functional group (functional group \u00d7 trial ANOVA; C6: F\n3, 508 = 18.89; p < 0.005; C7: F\n3, 508 =10.78; p < 0.005; C8: F\n3, 508 = 3.84; p < 0.01; C9: F\n3, 508 = 2.73, p < 0.05). Scheff\u00e9 post hoc comparisons generally showed that this effect was mainly due to ketones being less well learned than aldehydes and alcohols. Generally, the longer the carbon chain, the lower the heterogeneity in acquisition between functional groups. Thus, apart from short-chain ketones, all odours were learned similarly (reaching a level of acquisition between 60% and 80% in the last conditioning trial).\n\nTest Phase\nWhen the conditioned odour was presented in a test (Figure 1, grey panels), the level of PER recorded corresponded mainly to that found in the last acquisition trial (McNemar tests [2 \u00d7 2 Table]: in all cases p > 0.05). To compare generalisation after conditioning, and because acquisition levels were heterogeneous between odours, we built a generalisation matrix in which only bees responding to the CS at the end of training (3rd conditioning trial) were considered (Figure 2). The number of individuals included in the statistical analysis varied within each \u2018training odour/test odour' pair. The number of bees completing the tests varied between 17 and 28 for primary alcohols, between 13 and 29 for secondary alcohols, between 23 and 30 for aldehydes, and between 11 and 31 for ketones. The responses to the CS in the tests ranged between 70% and 100% in the generalisation matrix. All further analyses were carried out on this matrix. In the following sections, we will use the matrix data to analyse generalisation within and between functional groups, within and between chain lengths, and the asymmetries in olfactory generalisation.\n\nFigure 2 Olfactory Generalisation Matrix\nThe generalisation matrix represents the percentage of PER in the tests performed by bees that actually learned the CS, that is, bees that responded to the CS at the third conditioning trial (n = 1,457). Upper part: percentages recorded. Lower part: colour-coded graphic display grouping the level of responses in ten 10% response categories. Red, maximal response; light blue, minimal response.\n\nGeneralisation within Functional Groups\n\nFigure 3A shows the percentage of PER to odours having different (white quadrants) or the same (grey quadrants) functional group as the conditioned odour. High levels of PER to odours different from the trained one correspond to high generalisation. In order to better visualise generalisation as depending on functional groups, we pooled all the observed responses within each quadrant of Figure 3A (i.e., not considering chain length) and calculated the resulting percentage of PER (Figure 3B). Grey bars correspond to generalisation to the same functional group; white bars correspond to generalisation to different functional groups. Generalisation mainly occurred within a given functional group (grey bars). This pattern was clearest for aldehydes (Figure 3B, 3rd row) because bees conditioned to aldehydes responded with a high probability to other aldehydes but showed lower responses to any other odour (see also the clear aldehyde \u201cresponse block\u201d in Figure 2).\n\nFigure 3 Generalisation Depending on Functional Groups\n(A) Data of the generalisation matrix (see Figure 2) represented as two-dimensional graphs for each conditioned odour. The right ordinate represents the CSs categorised in four functional groups, primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones (from top to bottom). The abscissa represents the test odours aligned in the same order as the conditioned odours (from left to right). The left ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to the test odours after being trained to a given odour. Each quadrant in the figure represents generalisation responses to one functional group after training for the same (grey quadrants) or to a different functional group (white quadrants).\n\n(B) Same data as in (A), but the observed responses within each quadrant were pooled and the resulting percentage of responses per quadrant was calculated. The abscissa and the right ordinate represent the four functional groups. The left ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to each of these groups after being trained to a given group. Grey bars correspond to grey quadrants in (A) and represent generalisation to the same functional group as the conditioned one. White bars correspond to white quadrants in (A) and represent generalisation to a functional group different from the conditioned one: 1-ol, 2-ol, al, and one mean primary alcohol, secondary alcohol, aldehyde, and ketone, respectively. Asterisks indicate significant differences along a row or a column (p < 0.001)\n\n(C) Within-functional group generalisation, depending on chain length. The abscissa represents the functional groups tested. The ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to the functional groups tested after being trained to a given chain-length (lines). Thus, for instance, the first point to the left for C9 molecules (black circles) represents generalisation to 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, and 1-octanol after conditioning to 1-nonanol. A significant heterogeneity was found in within-functional group generalisation for C8 and C9 but not for C6 and C7 molecules.\n\n(D) Generalisation within-functional groups. The figure shows results from pooling the data of (C) corresponding to each functional group. Each point shows the percentage of proboscis extensions to odours of the same functional group as the conditioned odour. Within-group generalisation was significantly heterogeneous (asterisks, p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons showed that generalisation within aldehydes was significantly higher than within primary alcohols or ketones and marginally higher than within secondary alcohols (different letters indicate significant differences).\n\nWe analysed within-functional group generalisation as depending on chain length (see Figure 3C). To this end we represented generalisation from C6, C7, C8, and C9 molecules having a given functional group to the other compounds having the same functional group (e.g., Figure 3C, black circle curve, first data point: generalisation to 1-hexanol, 1-heptanol, and 1-octanol after conditioning to 1-nonanol). A significant heterogeneity appeared for C8 and C9 molecules (\u03c72 = 12.60 and 14.30, respectively, p < 0.01 in both cases, n = 67\u201385) but not for C6 and C7 molecules (p > 0.05). In the case of C8 and C9 molecules, generalisation was significantly higher within aldehydes (p < 0.05).\n\nWhen comparing within-group generalisation over all four functional groups (Figure 3D), a significant heterogeneity appeared (\u03c72 = 14.40, df = 3, p < 0.01, n = 276\u2013316). Pairwise comparisons (using a corrected threshold for multiple comparisons: \u03b1\u2032 = 0.017) showed that generalisation within aldehydes was significantly higher than within primary alcohols (\u03c72 = 11.80, df = 1, p < 0.0006) and ketones (\u03c72 = 9.90, df = 1, p < 0.005) and close to significance in favour of aldehydes when compared to secondary alcohols (\u03c72 = 4.40, df = 1, 0.017 < p < 0.05).\n\nGeneralisation within Chain Lengths\n\nFigure 4A shows the generalisation responses of bees to odours having different (white quadrants) or the same (grey quadrants) chain length as the conditioned odour. In order to better visualise generalisation as depending on chain length, we pooled all the observed responses within each quadrant of Figure 4A and calculated the resulting percentage of PER (Figure 4B). Grey bars correspond to generalisation to the same chain length; white bars correspond to generalisation to different chain lengths. Generalisation was highest in the case of odours with the same or similar chain length.\n\nFigure 4 Generalisation Depending on Chain Length\n(A) Data of the generalisation matrix (see Figure 2) represented as two-dimensional graphs for each conditioned odour. The right ordinate represents the CSs categorised in four chain lengths, C6, C7, C8, and C9 molecules (from top to bottom). The abscissa represents the test odours aligned in the same order as the conditioned odours (from left to right). The left ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to the test odours after being trained for a given odour. Each quadrant in the figure represents generalisation responses to one chain length after training for the same (grey quadrants) or to a different chain length (white quadrants).\n\n(B) Same data as in (A), but the observed responses within each quadrant were pooled and the resulting percentage of responses per quadrant was calculated. The abscissa and the right ordinate represent the four chain-length categories. The left ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to each of these categories after being trained for a given chain-length category. Grey bars correspond to grey quadrants in (A) and represent generalisation to the same chain length as the conditioned one. White bars correspond to white quadrants in (A) and represent generalisation to a chain length different from the conditioned one: C6, C7, C8, and C9 mean chain length of 6, 7, 8, and 9 carbons, respectively. Asterisks indicate significant differences along a row or a column (p < 0.001).\n\n(C) Within chain-length generalisation as depending on functional group. The abscissa represents the chain lengths tested. The ordinate represents the percentage of proboscis extensions to the same chain length after being trained to a given functional group (lines). Thus, the first point to the left for ketones (red circles) represents generalisation to 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, and hexanal after conditioning to 2-hexanone; the second point represents generalisation to 1-heptanol, 2-heptanol, and heptanal after conditioning to 2-heptanone. A significant heterogeneity was found in within-chain-length generalisation for aldehydes and ketones.\n\n(D) Generalisation within-chain lengths. The figure results from pooling the data of (C) corresponding to each chain length. Each point shows the percentage of proboscis extensions to odours of the same chain length as the conditioned odour. Within-chain-length generalisation was significantly heterogeneous (asterisks, p < 0.001). Pairwise comparisons showed that generalisation within C9 molecules was significantly higher than within C7 and C6 molecules and marginally higher than within C8 molecules (different letters indicate significant differences).\n\nWe analysed within-chain length generalisation as depending on functional group (Figure 4C). To this end we represented generalisation from primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, aldehydes, or ketones of a given chain length to the other compounds having the same chain length (e.g., Figure 4C, red circle curve, first data point: generalisation to 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, and hexanal after conditioning to 2-hexanone). Generalisation within-chain length was generally higher for longer than for shorter chain lengths. This effect was significant for aldehydes (\u03c72 = 28.70, df = 3, p < 0.01, n = 75\u201380) but not for primary and secondary alcohols (\u03c72 = 5.20 and 3.4, df = 3, p > 0.05, n = 67\u201373 and n = 61\u201366, respectively). For ketones, a significant heterogeneity was found (\u03c72 = 10.00, df = 3, p < 0.05, n = 40\u201379), but generalisation was more important between C8 than between C7 molecules. The generalisation corresponding to other chain lengths fell in between.\n\nWhen comparing within-chain length generalisation over all four chain-length groups (Figure 4D, i.e., not considering functional group), a significant heterogeneity appeared \u03c72 = 23.2, df = 3, p < 0.001, n = 247\u2013293). Pairwise comparisons (using a corrected threshold for multiple comparisons: \u03b1\u2032 = 0.017) showed that within-chain length generalisation was significantly higher within C9 than within C6 (\u03c72 = 18.50, df = 1, p < 0.0001) and C7 molecules (\u03c72 = 15.00, df = 1, p < 0.0001). Generalisation within C8 molecules was close to significance when compared to generalisation within C9 molecules (\u03c72 = 5.00, df = 1, 0.017 < p < 0.05), and it was significantly higher than generalisation within C6 molecules (\u03c72 = 4.3, df = 1, 0.017 < p < 0.05).\n\nGeneralisation between Functional Groups\nTo analyse generalisation between groups, we took into account the responses to functional groups different from the conditioned one (see white bars in Figure 3B). Bees showed heterogeneous patterns of generalisation (all vertical and horizontal comparisons in Figure 3B were significant: \u03c72 > 37.70, df = 3, p < 0.001, in all eight cases). We found high between-group generalisation for primary and secondary alcohols: bees conditioned to secondary alcohols responded preferentially to primary alcohols, somewhat less to aldehydes, and even less to ketones (see Figures 3A and 3B, second row). A similar but less obvious response gradation was found for bees conditioned to primary alcohols Figures 3A and 3B, first row). In fact, the overall generalisation patterns were very similar for primary and secondary alcohols sharing the same chain length (see, for instance, the very close relationship between the two sets of blue [primary alcohol] and green curves [secondary alcohols] in Figure 4A).\n\nAs indicated before, bees conditioned to aldehydes generalised very little to odours belonging to other functional groups (see Figure 3B, third row). Contrarily, bees conditioned to other functional groups highly generalised to aldehydes (see third column \u2018al' in Figure 3B). This shows that generalisation between aldehydes and odours belonging to other functional groups was asymmetrical. The topic of asymmetric generalisation will be considered below in more detail.\n\nGeneralisation between Chain Lengths\nTo analyse generalisation between chain lengths, we took into account the responses to chain lengths that differed from the conditioned one (see white bars in Figure 4B). In general, responses to molecules with different chain lengths followed a clear decreasing gradient, depending on the difference in the number of carbon atoms between the molecules considered (see Figure 4B; all horizontal and vertical comparisons were significant, \u03c72 > 16.3, df = 3, p < 0.001 in all eight cases). For instance, when conditioned to a C9 molecule (see Figure 4B, fourth row), bees responded in 53%, 31%, and 23% of the cases to C8, C7, and C6 molecules, respectively, while they responded to C9 molecules in 67% of the cases. This gradient was also evident when generalisation took place between functional groups: for instance, after training with 2-nonanol (see Figure 3A, second row), the response of bees to odours of different functional groups (solid lines in white boxes) always followed a similar decreasing tendency with the same (C9) or similar (C8) chain length on top.\n\nAsymmetry in Olfactory Generalisation\nAs previously mentioned, some groups like aldehydes induced asymmetrical cross-generalisation (i.e., bees responded less to other functional groups after training for aldehydes than to aldehydes after training for other functional groups). We analysed this asymmetrical generalisation and built an asymmetry matrix (Figure 5A). To this end, we calculated for each odour pair (A and B) the difference (in percentage) between generalisation from A to B and generalisation from B to A. Such differences were ranked in 10% categories from \u221255% to 55%. White boxes indicate no asymmetries. Blue shades in Figure 5A indicate that cross-generalisation was biased towards odour A (i.e., conditioning to A resulted in lower generalisation to B while conditioning to B resulted in higher generalisation to A); red shades indicate that cross-generalisation was biased towards odour B (i.e., conditioning to A resulted in higher generalisation to B while conditioning to B resulted in lower generalisation to A). This representation showed that some odours induced generalisation while other odours diminished it. For instance, hexanal was well learnt but induced low generalisation to other odours, except to other aldehydes. On the other hand, bees conditioned to other odours very often generalised to hexanal. Thus, a clear blue row (or a red column) corresponds to hexanal in the asymmetry matrix. Conversely, 2-hexanone induced high generalisation to other odours but received few responses as a test odour. Thus a red row (or a blue column) corresponds to 2-hexanone in the asymmetry matrix. Most odours, however, showed little or no asymmetry. Figure 5B presents the mean asymmetry found for each training odour. In six cases, the mean asymmetry deviated significantly from zero, which represents a theoretically perfect symmetry (t-test). Two odours (red bars) significantly induced generalisation (2-hexanone and 2-hexanol, t-test, df = 14, p < 0.001 and p < 0.01, respectively), while four odours (blue bars) diminished it significantly (hexanal, heptanal, and octanal, and 2-nonanone, t-test, df = 14, p < 0.001 for the former and p < 0.01 for the three latter odours).\n\nFigure 5 Asymmetric Generalisation between Odours\n(A) The asymmetry matrix depicts asymmetric cross-generalisation between odours. For each odour pair (A and B), the difference (percentage) between generalisation from A to B and generalisation from B to A was calculated. Such differences were ranked in 10% categories varying from blue (\u221255%) to red (55%). Blue shades indicate that cross-generalisation was biased towards odour A (i.e., conditioning to A resulted in lower generalisation to B, while conditioning to B resulted in higher generalisation to A); red shades indicate that cross-generalisation was biased towards odour B (i.e., conditioning to A resulted in higher generalisation to B, while conditioning to B resulted in lower generalisation to A). For this reason, each odour pair (A and B) appears twice in the matrix, once in the upper-left of the black diagonal line, and once in the lower-right of the black diagonal line, with opposite values. See, for example, the two cells outlined in green for the pair 2-hexanone/2-octanol.\n\n(B) Mean generalisation induced or diminished by each odour A in (A). Each bar represents the mean asymmetry of the respective horizontal line in the asymmetry matrix. Red bars show that an odour induced more generalisation than it received, while blue bars show the opposite. Significant generalisation asymmetries were found in six out of 16 cases (**, p < 0.01; ***, p < 0.001).\n\nOlfactory Space\nIn order to define a putative olfactory space for the honeybee, we performed a principal component analysis (PCA) on our data to represent in a limited number of dimensions the relative relationships between odorants in a 16-dimension perceptual space (Figure 6A). The first three factors represented 31%, 29%, and 15% of overall variance in the data (total of the first three factors: 75%). The analysis showed a clear organisation of odours depending on their chemical characteristics. First, chain length was very clearly represented by the first factor (see upper-right graph in Figure 6A), from C6 to C9 molecules from the right to the left. On the other hand, the chemical group was mostly represented by factors 2 and 3. Whereas factor 2 separated mostly aldehydes from alcohols, with ketones falling between them, factor 3 segregated ketones from all other odours (lower-right graph, Figure 6A). None of these factors separated primary and secondary alcohols. This analysis indicates that the chemical features of molecules (chain length and functional group), which are sometimes thought of as artificial perceptual (psychophysical) dimensions determined by experimenters [34] can be considered as true inner dimensions of the bees' perceptual space. Cluster analyses performed on the data segregated odours mostly according to their chain length. In the first group (Figure 6B, upper part), we found two subgroups, short-chain alcohols (C6 and C7, primary and secondary alcohols) and short-chain ketones (C6 to C8). On the other hand (Figure 6B, lower part), three clear subgroups were formed: short-chain aldehydes (C6 and C7), long-chain alcohols (C8 and C9, primary and secondary alcohols), and a last group with long-chain aldehydes (C8 and C9) and 2-nonanone. Very similar results were obtained using Euclidian or city-block metrics.\n\nFigure 6 A Putative Honeybee Olfactory Space\n(A) Left: The olfactory space is defined on the basis of the three principal factors that accounted for 76% of overall data variance after a PCA performed to represent the relative relationships between odorants. Primary alcohols are indicated in blue, secondary alcohols in green, aldehydes in black, and ketones in red. Different chain-lengths are indicated as C6, C7, C8, and C9, which corresponds to their number of carbon atoms. For each functional group, arrows follow the increasing order of carbon-chain lengths. Right: Chain length was very clearly represented by factor 1. C6 to C9 molecules are ordered from right to left. The chemical group was mostly represented by factors 2 and 3. Whereas factor 2 separated mostly aldehydes from alcohols, with ketones falling between them, factor 3 separated ketones from all other odours. None of these three factors separated primary and secondary alcohols.\n\n(B) Euclidean cluster analysis. The analysis separated odours mostly according to their chain length. Linkage distance is correlated to odour distances in the whole 16-dimension space. The farther to the right two odours/odour groups are connected, the higher the perceptual distance between them (odour colour codes are the same as in [A]).\n\nCorrelation between Optophysiological and Behavioural Measures of Odour Similarity\nWe asked whether optophysiological measures of odour similarity, obtained using calcium imaging techniques at the level of the honeybee AL [22,23,24,35], correspond to perceptual odour similarity measures as defined in our putative honeybee olfactory space. We thus calculated the Euclidian distance between odour representations in our 16-dimension \u201cbehavioural\u201d space for all odour pairs (120 pairs). We then calculated distances between odours in optical imaging experiments, using the odour maps by Sachse et al. [23]. A correlation analysis was performed between both datasets. This analysis was possible because both the study by Sachse et al.[23] and our study used the same set of odours delivered under the same conditions. Figure 7A presents the correlation obtained, including all 120 odour pairs. Both sets of data were highly significantly correlated (r = 0.54, t\n118 = 7.43, p < 2.10\u201310), a result that shows that odours, which were found to be physiologically similar in the optical imaging study, were also evaluated as similar in behavioural terms. Note, however, that data points cluster quite broadly around the main trend line, showing that many exceptions were found. In order to use a more exact measure of physiological odour similarity, we used the correlation results between primary and secondary alcohol maps provided by Sachse et al. [23]. By correlating this more exact value of physiological similarity with our behavioural data, we also found a highly significant relationship between physiological and behavioural data (Figure 7B; r = 0.82, t\n26 = 7.83, p < 7.10\u20138). The correlation coefficient achieved with this second method was significantly higher than that achieved with the first method (Z = 2.52, p < 0.05). A better fit between the two datasets was thus found, although outliers were still present in the data. These two analyses show that optophysiological and behavioural measures of odour similarity correlate well using the methods described here. Thus, in the case of the honeybee, olfactory neural activity corresponds to olfactory perception.\n\nFigure 7 Correspondence between Perceptual and Physiological Odour Similarity\n(A) Correlation between optophysiological measures of odour similarity (carried out using calcium imaging recordings [23]) and our behavioural measures of odour similarity. Euclidian distance between odour representations in our 16-dimension \u201cbehavioural\u201d space for all odour pairs (120 pairs, x axes) and distances between odours in optical imaging experiments, using the odour category maps displayed by Sachse et al. [23] (also 120 pairs, y axes) were calculated. This correlation, including all 120 odour pairs, was highly significant (r = 0.54, p < 0.001). Odours found to be similar in the optical imaging study were also similar in the behaviour. Data points cluster quite broadly around the main trend line, showing that many exceptions were found.\n\n(B) Correlation between measures of optophysiological similarity carried out using the optical imaging technique [23] and our behavioural measure of odour similarity. Using the exact data given for primary and secondary alcohols [23], a much better correlation between the two datasets was achieved than in (A) (r = 0.82, p < 0.001), although outliers were still found in the data.\n\nDiscussion\nIn the present work, we have studied perceptual similarity among odorants in the honeybee, using an appetitive-conditioning paradigm, the olfactory conditioning of the PER [17,18]. We showed that all odorants presented could be learned, although acquisition was lower for short-chain ketones. Generalisation varied, depending both on the functional group and on the carbon-chain length of odours trained. Generalisation was very high among primary and secondary alcohols, being high from ketones to alcohols and aldehydes and low from aldehydes to all other tested odours; thus, in some cases, cross-generalisation between odorants was asymmetric. Some odours, like short-chain ketones or aldehydes, induced more asymmetries than other odours. Higher generalisation was found between long-chain than between short-chain molecules. Functional group and carbon-chain length constitute orthogonal inner dimensions of a putative olfactory space of honeybees. Perceptual distances in such a space correlate well with physiological distances determined from optophysiological recordings performed at the level of the primary olfactory centre, the AL [23] such that olfactory neural activity corresponds to olfactory perception.\n\nPrevious studies have attempted to describe olfactory generalisation in honeybees and to study structure\u2013activity relationships [19,20,36,37,38]. These studies generally supported the view that generalisation mainly happens when odours belong to the same chemical group. Moreover, they also suggested that the rules underlying olfactory learning and perception of different chemical classes [20] or of particular odorants (e.g., citral [20,37]) may vary. However, these studies used differential training, thus inducing several generalisation gradients (excitatory and inhibitory) that make the interpretation of generalisation responses difficult [21,36]. Furthermore, these studies were carried out on a rather discrete number of odour pairs [37], did not detail the results obtained with individual odour combinations [20], or used a very reduced number of bees per conditioned odour ([21]; two bees per odorant).Thus, the present study is the first one to provide (i) generalisation data based on absolute conditioning (i.e., only one odour conditioned at a time), (ii) a systematical test of all odour combinations, (iii) robust sample sizes for each experimental situation, and (iv) important generalisation gradients. These are in our view crucial prerequisites to describe odour perception and similarity in a precise way.\n\nChemical Group and Chain Length\nSeveral studies in other species have shown the importance of functional group and carbon-chain length of the odour molecules for behavioural responses to odours. Differences in the response between molecules of diverse aliphatic and aromatic homologue odour classes (i.e., differing in functional group, chain length, and overall molecule form) were investigated in moths [39,40], cockroaches [41], rats [42], squirrel monkeys [4,43] and humans [38,44,45]. These studies show that both functional group and chain length affect the perceived quality of an odorant. Concerning chain length, the greater the difference in the number of carbons between odours, the easier the discrimination and the lower the generalisation ([21,40,42,44] and present study).\n\nIn our study, both chemical group and chain length of odour molecules determined the bees' generalisation responses. Bees mostly generalised to other odours when these shared the same functional group. This effect was observed for all functional groups (see Figure 3B) but was strongest for aldehydes. Other studies have found that aldehydes induced high within-group generalisation [20,21,36]. Thus, aldehydes may represent a behaviourally relevant chemical class for honeybees. Between-functional group generalisation depended on the functional group considered. It was high between primary and secondary alcohols, which appear therefore perceptually similar to the bees, and low between other chemical groups. Bees clearly generalised between odours that shared the same chain length. Increasing chain length promoted generalisation. Moreover, generalisation to other chain lengths decreased if the difference in the number of carbons between odours increased. This suggests a perceptual continuum between different chain lengths (but see below). Thus, the chemical structure of the odorants is critical for determining the amount of generalisation.\n\nA Putative Olfactory Space for the Honeybee\nWe found that the two controlled physical characteristics of odour molecules used in this study, functional group and chain length, correspond to internal dimensions in the bees' olfactory perceptual space such as the three most important factors extracted in our PCA analysis, one mainly represented chain length and the other two were mostly influenced by functional group. Cluster analyses allowed separating odours in clusters according to their functional groups and their chain length. Interestingly, C6 and C7 molecules and C8 and C9 molecules were mainly grouped together, so that, for instance, all short-chain primary and secondary alcohols were grouped on one side, and all long-chain alcohols on the other side. The same happened for aldehydes, and in a different way for ketones (C9 separated from the rest). This discrepancy suggests that, although chain length appears mostly as a perceptual continuum in the PCA analysis, there may be a perceptual \u201cjump\u201d between short-chain and long-chain molecules.\n\nNeural Bases of Odour Perception\nBoth in vertebrates and in invertebrates, studies quantifying the neural responses to structurally similar odours in the first relay of the olfactory pathway have been performed (olfactory bulb: e.g., [46,47,48,49]; AL: [23,50]). These studies show that activity patterns are more similar when the difference in the number of carbons between molecules is small. It was hypothesised that such a physiological similarity is the basis for olfactory discrimination and generalisation as measured behaviourally. This has indeed been reported for mucosal activity in mice [51], electrical mitral cell activity [42], and/or radiolabelled 2-deoxyglucose uptake in the rat olfactory bulb [32]. Also, in Manduca sexta, qualitative similarities were observed between the degree of behavioural generalisation according to chain length [40] and the degree of overlap between electrophysiological temporal patterns of activity across AL neurons [50].\n\nSeveral correspondences, but also discrepancies, can be found between our behavioural results and the physiological results obtained at the level of the bee AL [23]. First, within the regions of the AL accessible to optical imaging (about 25% of the glomeruli), patterns of glomerular activity for different odours are highly dependent on chain length, but much less so on chemical group. Thus, most active glomeruli respond to several functional groups as long as the chain length corresponds, but respond differentially to different chain lengths. Glomeruli T1\u201328 and T1\u201352 are specialised in short-chain molecules (respectively C5\u2013C7 and C6\u2013C7), whilst glomeruli T1\u201333 and T1\u201317 are specialised in long-chain molecules (respectively C7\u2013C9 and C8\u2013C9). These glomeruli also respond to most functional groups but in a graded way. For instance, glomerulus T1\u201317 responds more to alcohols in the intermediate range than to aldehydes or ketones, whereas T1\u201352 generally responds more to ketones in the short range, more to aldehydes in the long range, and overall little to alcohols. No individual glomerulus was found that responds specifically to a chemical group. However, it should be kept in mind that some regions of the ALs are not yet accessible to calcium imaging techniques (about 75% of the lobe; see below). Thus, a possible explanation is that glomeruli responding to specific chemical groups (or with responses more dependent on chemical groups than on chain length) were not imaged.\n\nSecond, primary and secondary alcohols induce extremely similar activation patterns in the AL, but subtle differences could be found, so that for a given chain length, the representation of a secondary alcohol was between that of the primary alcohol of the same chain length and that with one less carbon atom (see Figure 6B in Sachse et al. [23]). We found a similar arrangement of alcohol representations, with primary and secondary alcohols alternating on a common axis (see Figure 6A).\n\nThird, optical imaging data showed that higher chain lengths support more similarity between patterns (see Figure 6C in Sachse et al. [23]). Our finding that longer chain lengths induce more generalisation agrees with the imaging data. These last two points suggest that the general rules governing odour similarity at the neural and the behavioural level are similar.\n\nThe Correspondence between Perceptual and Physiological Odour Similarity\nWe aimed at comparing behavioural and physiological data in a more precise way, using correlation analyses between our behavioural similarity matrix, in which distances between two odour points represent psychological distances between stimuli, and a physiological similarity matrix obtained from optophysiological recordings of glomerular activation patterns [23]. Comparing distances between odours in these two matrixes resulted in a good correlation. This means that glomerular activity patterns recorded in the brain could predict behavioural responses and vice versa.\n\nThe optophysiological dataset of Sachse et al. [23] has nevertheless some limitations with respect to the objectives of our work: (i) bath application measurements of AL activity using calcium green as a dye [23] record the combined activity of several neuronal populations of the AL, among which primary-afferent activity seems to have the most important contribution [52]; (ii) such measurements survey only the dorsal part of the AL, which constitutes 25% of the neuropile studied; and (iii) learning alters odour representations in the AL [35,53,54] such that there could be a mismatch between our data collected after olfactory conditioning and the dataset of Sachse et al. [23], which was obtained from naive bees.\n\nWith respect to the first point, it could be argued that the AL circuitry transforms the primary-afferent representations of odours [25] such that recordings where primary-afferent receptor activity is predominant are not very useful for evaluating optophysiological similarity. However the very fact that we found a significant correlation between our behavioural data and the imaging data by Sachse et al. [23], strongly suggests that the perceptual quality of odorants mostly appears at the peripheral level. Clearly, this correlation was not perfect, and odour quality is most probably refined by further processing within the AL, and/or at higher stages of the olfactory pathway, such as in the mushroom bodies or the lateral protocerebrum. In honeybees, new methods have been developed, which allow recording selectively the activity of the efferent PNs [25]. However, the two studies published using this method [25,26] do not provide an extensive odorant matrix as that provided by Sachse et al. [23]. In this sense the study on which we based our correlation analysis is certainly the only one of its kind published to date. However, in the future, a careful comparison of our behavioural data with both bath-applied imaging data emphasising receptor neuron input (as done here) and selective imaging of PNs would be extremely helpful in understanding to what extent AL processing shapes odour perceptual quality.\n\nWith respect to the second point, calcium imaging recordings of AL activity are certainly limited to the dorsal part of the AL, which is the region accessible when the head capsule is opened in order to expose the brain for recordings. This is an inherent limitation of the method that the use of two-photon microscopy during calcium imaging measurements will soon allow us to overcome, as shown already by recordings obtained in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster [55].\n\nFinally, with respect to the third point, it is known that learning alters odour representations in the AL, when bees are trained in a differential conditioning procedure, with one odour rewarded and another odour unrewarded [53]. This is not the conditioning procedure used in our work, which was absolute (only one odour rewarded at a time). In the bee, changes in the olfactory code due to absolute conditioning seem to be difficult to detect (C. G. Galizia, personal communication), such that this point may not be so critical for our correlation analysis. In any case, if there are changes in odour representations due to conditioning, recording glomerular activity patterns after conditioning would only improve our correlation analyses.\n\nGeneralisation Asymmetries between Odours\nWe have found a number of asymmetries in olfactory cross-generalisation, with bees responding more to odour B after learning odour A than in the reverse situation. Previous studies have observed such a phenomenon, but it was mostly related to olfactory compounds with pheromonal value (aggregation pheromone citral [20,37] and alarm pheromones 2-heptanone and isoamyl acetate [56]). In the present study, we found that six out of the 16 odours used induced significant generalisation asymmetries over the whole matrix; none of these six odours was related to any known pheromone (see Table 1). Generalisation asymmetries seem to be a general feature of honeybee olfaction.\n\nTable 1 Chemical and Biological Characteristics of the Odours Used\nThe odours were listed by functional groups (primary alcohols, secondary alcohols, aldehydes, and ketones) and purity. Odour vapour pressure values (VP), pheromone characteristics and occurrence in floral scents (after Knudsen et al. [66]) are also given\n\n\naNotation: *1, releases altering at hive entrance and stinging, repels clustering bees, inhibits scenting, repels foragers (sting chamber); *2, releases altering at hive entrance, inhibits foraging activity, repels foragers (sting chamber); *3, repels at hive entrance, releases stinging, encourages foraging activity (sting chamber); *4, releases stinging, inhibits foraging activity, repels foragers (mandibular glands)\n\nOdour concentration can affect stimulus salience. In our work, generalisation asymmetries could not be directly explained by differences in odour concentration (through differences in vapour pressure), because, for instance, the two odours with the highest vapour pressure in our sample (2-hexanone and hexanal) produced totally opposite results: 2-hexanone induced important generalisation, while hexanal strongly reduced generalisation. Also, although we used 16 different odours with a range of different vapour pressures, we found that acquisition was very similar for most odours, except for the short-chain ketones, which were less easily learned. This suggests that almost all odours used had a good salience for bees. Wright and Smith [57] studied the effect of odour concentration in generalisation in honeybees. They found that discrimination increased with concentration for structurally dissimilar odours but not for similar odours. Further experiments using odorants at different concentrations should be carried out to determine the effect of odour concentration on generalisation asymmetries.\n\nGeneralisation asymmetries could be due to innate or experience-dependent differences in the salience of odours for honeybees, such that more salient odours would induce higher generalisation than less salient odours. This interpretation implies that most aldehydes (hexanal, heptanal, and octanal) are highly salient odours for honeybees, because aldehydes showed a clear \u201cfunctional group\u201d effect, which could reveal a certain bias of the olfactory system towards these odours. Ketones, on the other hand, showed a heterogeneous effect, as 2-hexanone seemed to have a low salience (it was not well learnt) and induced a high generalisation to other odours, while 2-nonanone consistently reduced generalisation to other odours. In the group of alcohols, only 2-hexanol induced generalisation to other odours. Therefore, only aldehydes showed a clear group effect on generalisation asymmetry. This effect could be due to innate odour preferences [58,59] or to previous odour exposure within the hive [60,61]. Innate odour preferences could be related to natural, floral odours that were more consistently associated with food resources [20,62]. It is thus important to investigate whether or not such ecological trends exist in the natural flora associated with the honeybee and whether or not other bee species also present such clear biases, in particular towards aldehydes.\n\nConversely, asymmetries could be the result of the conditioning procedure. This would be the case if conditioning modifies odour representation in an asymmetric way. Indeed, experience-induced modifications of odour representations have been found at the level of the honeybee AL. Thus, odour-evoked calcium signals in the AL can be modified by elemental [53] and nonelemental olfactory learning paradigms [35] such that the representations of odours that have to be discriminated become more distinct and uncorrelated as a result of learning. In the fruit fly D. melanogaster, new glomeruli become active after olfactory learning [54], while in the moth M. sexta new neuronal units in the AL are recruited after olfactory learning [63]. These elements suggest that modifications of odour representation after learning two different odours could indeed be asymmetrical: if, for instance, the neuronal representation of A after conditioning becomes A\u2032, which is slightly farther away from B than A in the bee's olfactory space, and if the perceptual representation of B becomes B\u2032 after conditioning, which is closer to A than B, then bees would show less generalisation in behavioural tests from A to B than from B to A. On the level of the AL network, glomeruli are connected via lateral inhibitory interneurons [25,64,65]. Due to this, glomerular activation by an odour A will transiently inactivate parts of the network and possibly parts encoding a subsequent odour B. Optical imaging experiments have shown that inhibition between glomeruli may be asymmetric [25]. In our case, glomeruli activated by odour A may inhibit glomeruli coding for odour B, while glomeruli coding for odour B may not inhibit those coding for odour A. In this hypothesis, asymmetric cross-generalisation could reflect a sensory phenomenon. Nevertheless, we believe that inhibitions at the level of the AL are rather short-lived such that a purely sensory priming effect seems improbable. If, however, the strength of lateral inhibitions between glomeruli can be modified by learning as proposed by Linster and Smith [65], then asymmetrical generalisation would come from the fact that inhibitory lateral connections are modified. In order to determine the physiological mechanisms underlying asymmetrical cross-generalisation and the possible role of AL networks in it, future work will aim at visualising the evolution of glomerular activity patterns during and after olfactory conditioning with odours that showed asymmetries in our study.\n\nConclusion\nWe have shown that the two odorant physical dimensions that varied in our study, functional group and chain-length, correspond to internal dimensions of the bees' olfactory space. Generalisation was mainly due to these two characteristics with generalisation within functional group being more important. Such generalisation was particularly high for aldehydes, a fact that suggests that these odours may have an intrinsic value for bees. Generalisation between functional groups was mostly found between primary and secondary alcohols. Furthermore, a gradient in generalisation was found with respect to chain length. Asymmetric cross-generalisation was found in the case of certain odorants. Such asymmetries were neither strictly linked to chain length nor to functional group, but depended on particular odorants.\n\nThe 16 odours used in our work represent a small part of the odorants that bees may encounter in nature (see Knudsen et al. [66]). For a complete description of the bees' olfactory perceptual space, more odours having other molecular features have to be studied. New dimensions in the bees' perceptual space could then be found.\n\nFinally, and most important, the perceptual distance between odours can be predicted on the basis of the differences in the patterns of glomerular activation in the first relay of the olfactory pathway: the AL, and vice versa. This emphasises the relevance of studying activity patterns in the brain in imaging studies and trying to relate them to perceptual tasks. Our work shows that this objective, which is at the core of cognitive neurosciences, can be achieved using an invertebrate model such as the honeybee.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nInsects\nEvery experimental day, honeybees were captured at the entrance of an outdoor hive and were cooled on ice for 5 min until they stopped moving. Then they were harnessed in small metal tubes in such a way that only the head protruded. The mouthparts and the antennae could move freely. Harnessed bees were left for 3 h in a resting room without disturbance. Fifteen minutes before starting the experiments, each subject was checked for intact PER by lightly touching one antenna with a toothpick imbibed with 50% (w/w) sucrose solution without subsequent feeding. Extension of the proboscis beyond the virtual line between the open mandibles was counted as PER. Animals that did not show the reflex were not used in the experiments.\n\nStimulation apparatus\nThe odours were delivered by an odour cannon, which allowed the presentation of up to seven different odours, and a clean airstream [67]. Each odour was applied to a filter paper placed within a syringe (see below) that was connected to the cannon. An airstream was produced by an air pump (Rena Air 400, Annecy, France) and directed to the relevant syringes with electronic valves (Lee Company, Voisins-le-Bretonneux, France) controlled by the experimenter via a computer. In the absence of odour stimulation, the airstream passed through a syringe containing a clean filter paper piece (clean airstream). During odour stimulation, the airstream was directed to a syringe containing a filter paper loaded with odour. After a 4-s stimulation, the airstream was redirected to the odourless syringe until the next stimulation.\n\nStimuli\nSixteen odours (Sigma Aldrich, Deisenhofen, Germany) were used in our work as CS and test stimuli (see Table 1). Racemic mixtures were used in the case of molecules that had chiral carbons. These odours are present in flowers and some in pheromones (see Table 1). Pure odorants (4 \u03bcl) were applied to 1-cm2 filter paper pieces, which were transferred to 1-ml syringes, cut to 0.7 ml to make them fit into the odour cannon. Fifty percent sugar solution was used throughout as US.\n\nExperimental design\nOur work was designed to obtain a generalisation matrix with 16 different odours. Ideally, after conditioning each of the 16 odours as CS, the response to each odour (including the CS) should be measured (i.e., 16 \u00d7 16 = 256 cells). However, testing 16 odours implies presenting them without reward, a situation that may result in extinction of the learned response due to the repeated unrewarded odour presentations. Preliminary experiments were performed in which four groups of 180 bees were trained along three trials to 1-hexanol, 2-octanol, linalool, and limonene, respectively. Training was followed by tests with the four different odours, including the conditioned one. These experiments showed that after three conditioning trials, the response of the bees to the CS in the four tests remained at the same level, independently of the order of occurrence of the CS such that it was not influenced by extinction. We thus kept this protocol for the 16 \u00d7 16 matrix. Each of the 2,048 bees used in this study was thus subjected to three conditioning trials with their respective CS, and to four test trials, each with a different odour chosen among the 16 possible odours. Intertrial intervals of 10 min were used throughout. A randomisation schedule (detailed below) was developed for the test phase to reduce any possible day- and odour-combination effects.\n\nConditioning trials\nOne bee at a time was placed into the conditioning setup. The total duration of each trial was 37.5 s After 15 s of familiarisation to the experimental context, the CS was presented to the bee for 4 s. Three sec after onset of the CS, the antennae were stimulated with the US, leading to a proboscis extension. The bee was allowed to feed for 3 s. Stimulus overlap was 1 s (interstimulus interval, 3 s). The bee was left in the conditioning place for 17.5 s and then removed.\n\nTest trials\nThe procedure was similar to that for conditioning trials but no US was given after odour delivery. After the four test trials, PER to the US was checked once again. Animals unable to show PER at this point were not considered for the analyses. Overall, less than 2% of the bees died during the experiment, and less than 1% of the survivors showed no US reaction at the end of the tests.\n\nRandomisation schedule\nOn each day, two to three experimenters worked in parallel, each training 16 bees at a time. In the training phase, the 16 bees were divided into four groups of four bees, and each group was trained to one of the 16 different odours. In the test phase, four out of 16 odours were presented to each of the 16 bees. The combination of four odours tested together changed in each experiment, so that any effect of having particular odours in the same test combination was suppressed. The whole experiment was planned in such a way that in any of our experimental groups, two given odours appeared at least once, but a maximum of three times together in a test sequence. This was possible by carefully picking out eight of the 16! (2.1 \u00d7 1013) possible experimental plans. Additionally, within each group, the testing order for the four test odours was determined randomly.\n\nData analysis and statistics\nDuring the experiments, we recorded the response to the presented odour, that is, whether bees extended their proboscis after the onset of the odour and before the presentation of the sucrose solution in the case of reinforced trials, such that the anticipatory response recorded was due to the odour and not to the US. Multiple responses during a CS were counted as a single PER. The percentages of PER recorded during acquisition were used to plot acquisition curves (see Figure 1). To test whether bees learnt the different odours in a similar way, ANOVAs for repeated measurements were used both for between-group and for within-group comparisons. Monte Carlo studies have shown that it is permissible to use ANOVA on dichotomous data only under controlled conditions [68], which are met by the experiments reported in this study: equal cell frequencies and at least 40 df of the error term. The \u03b1 level was set to 0.05 (two-tailed).\n\nTo ensure that we analysed a true generalisation response in the tests, and hence built a true generalisation matrix, we kept only those bees which had actually learnt the CS (71% of the bees used in this work). We therefore performed new analyses that only included those bees that responded to the CS before the presentation of the US in the third conditioning trial. A lack of response to an odour in the tests could be due either to the fact that the bees had not made any association between CS and US or because their motivational level was low. For all odours tested, we observed that responses to the CS in the third conditioning trial were equivalent to responses to the CS in the tests (McNemar test; see Results). We represented the responses of the selected bees to the test odours (see Figure 2). As the numbers of bees were now heterogeneous in the different groups, we could not use ANOVAs to analyse the responses in the tests (see above). We thus used \u03c72 tests for all further between-group comparisons. In the case of multiple two-by-two comparisons, the significance threshold was corrected using the Dunn\u2013Sidak correction [\u03b1\u2032 = 1 \u2212 (1 \u2212 \u03b1)1/k where k is the number of two-by-two comparisons in which each dataset is used] in order to reduce the type I errors. Alpha values between \u03b1\u2032 and 0.05 were considered as near significant.\n\nOlfactory space\nTo observe the relationships between odours in a reduced number of dimensions, we performed a PCA, which identified orthogonal axes (factors) of maximum variance in the data, and thus projected the data into a lower-dimensionality space formed of a subset of the highest-variance components. We calculated the three factors, which accounted for most of the observed variance. Calculating distances between odours in the resulting putative olfactory space allowed the evaluation of their perceptual similarity, not only based on direct generalisation between these odours (i.e., generalisation from odour A to odour B and vice versa), but also including responses to these odours after conditioning to other odours (e.g., C, D, E, etc.). We performed cluster analyses to group odours, according to their respective distance in the olfactory space, using both Euclidian and city-block metrics, with Ward's classification method. Both metrics gave very similar results, so we later used only Euclidian metrics. Euclidian (i.e., direct) distances in the 16-dimensional space are defined as\n\n\n  \n\n\nwith i and j indicating odours, p the number of dimensions\u2014that is, conditioning groups\u2014and Xik the response of bees to odour i after conditioning to odour k. These distances were used in correlation analyses with optical imaging data (see below).\n\nCorrelation analysis between perceptual and optophysiological similarity measures\nWe studied whether or not physiological similarity between odours as determined by optical imaging studies of AL activity [22,23,35] actually reflects perceptual odour similarity for the bees. To this end, we performed correlation analyses between published optical imaging data that were obtained using the same set of odours as in our work [23] and our behavioural data. We used two sets of physiological data. First, to perform such a correlation on the whole dataset (including all 16 odours), we transcribed the activation maps presented by Sachse et al. [23] (see Figure 7) into activation levels for each glomerulus from zero to three, according to the following signal scale: dark blue (0%\u201320%) and light blue (>20%\u201340% activity), zero; green (>40%\u201360% activity), one; yellow (>60%\u201380% activity), two; and red (>80% activity), three. As the activity under 40% was less accurately separated from noise, activation levels between 0% and 40% were ranked as 0. Scaling the physiological data in this way instead of using the original imaging activation data, gave a good overview of physiological similarity between odours for imaging data (see Results). To provide a more precise correlation analysis between behavioural and imaging data, albeit on a more limited odour dataset (eight odours), we used exact correlation data ([23], Table 1). Each correlation value C, as calculated by Sachse et al. [23] between activity patterns for all pairs of primary and secondary alcohols, was converted into physiological distances by the operation 100 \u2212 C. All linear correlations were assessed by calculating Pearson's r, and using Student's t-test. Comparison between correlation coefficients obtained with the two methods was carried out statistically using a Z test as in [69].\n\nWe thank Nina Giotto for her help with the experiments and Giovanni Galizia, Monique Gauthier, Christiane Linster, and three anonymous referees for useful comments on previous versions of this work.

Although their biological importance has become clear, how they recognize and regulate target genes remains less well understood. Here, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements for functional miRNA\u2013target duplexes in vivo and distinguish classes of target sites with different functional properties. Target sites can be grouped into two broad categories. 5\u2032 dominant sites have sufficient complementarity to the miRNA 5\u2032 end to function with little or no support from pairing to the miRNA 3\u2032 end. Indeed, sites with 3\u2032 pairing below the random noise level are functional given a strong 5\u2032 end. In contrast, 3\u2032 compensatory sites have insufficient 5\u2032 pairing and require strong 3\u2032 pairing for function. We present examples and genome-wide statistical support to show that both classes of sites are used in biologically relevant genes. We provide evidence that an average miRNA has approximately 100 target sites, indicating that miRNAs regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes and that miRNA 3\u2032 ends are key determinants of target specificity within miRNA families.\n\nMicroRNA target site recognition falls into two broad categories: 5' dominant sites that require little support from microRNA 3' end; and 3' compensatory sites that require strong 3' pairing to function\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nMicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that serve as post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression in plants and animals. They act by binding to complementary sites on target mRNAs to induce cleavage or repression of productive translation (reviewed in [1,2,3,4]). The importance of miRNAs for development is highlighted by the fact that they comprise approximately 1% of genes in animals, and are often highly conserved across a wide range of species (e.g., [5,6,7]). Further, mutations in proteins required for miRNA function or biogenesis impair animal development [8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15].\n\nTo date, functions have been assigned to only a few of the hundreds of animal miRNA genes. Mutant phenotypes in nematodes and flies led to the discovery that the lin-4 and let-7 miRNAs control developmental timing [16,17], that lsy-6 miRNA regulates left\u2013right asymmetry in the nervous system [18], that bantam miRNA controls tissue growth [19], and that bantam and miR-14 control apoptosis [19,20]. Mouse miR-181 is preferentially expressed in bone marrow and was shown to be involved in hematopoietic differentiation [21]. Recently, mouse miR-375 was found to be a pancreatic-islet-specific miRNA that regulates insulin secretion [22].\n\nPrediction of miRNA targets provides an alternative approach to assign biological functions. This has been very effective in plants, where miRNA and target mRNA are often nearly perfectly complementary [23,24,25]. In animals, functional duplexes can be more variable in structure: they contain only short complementary sequence stretches, interrupted by gaps and mismatches. To date, specific rules for functional miRNA\u2013target pairing that capture all known functional targets have not been devised. This has created problems for search strategies, which apply different assumptions about how to best identify functional sites. As a result, the number of predicted targets varies considerably with only limited overlap in the top-ranking targets, indicating that these approaches might only capture subsets of real targets and/or may include a high number of background matches ([19,26,27,28,29,30]; reviewed by [31]). Nonetheless, a number of predicted targets have proven to be functional when subjected to experimental tests [19,26,27,29].\n\nA better understanding of the pairing requirements between miRNA and target would clearly improve predictions of miRNA targets in animals. It is known that defined cis-regulatory elements in Drosophila 3\u2032 UTRs are complementary to the 5\u2032 ends of certain miRNAs [32]. The importance of the miRNA 5\u2032 end has also emerged from the pairing characteristics and evolutionary conservation of known target sites [26], and from the observation of a non-random statistical signal specific to the 5\u2032 end in genome-wide target predictions [27]. Tissue culture experiments have also underscored the importance of 5\u2032 pairing and have provided some specific insights into the general structural requirements [29,33,34], though different studies have conflicted to some degree with each other, and with known target sites (reviewed in [31]). To date, no specific role has been ascribed to the 3\u2032 end of miRNAs, despite the fact that miRNAs tend to be conserved over their full length.\n\nHere, we systematically evaluate the minimal requirements for a functional miRNA\u2013target duplex in vivo. These experiments have allowed us to identify two broad categories of miRNA target sites. Targets in the first category, \u201c5\u2032 dominant\u201d sites, base-pair well to the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA. Although there is a continuum of 3\u2032 pairing quality within this class, it is useful to distinguish two subtypes: \u201ccanonical\u201d sites, which pair well at both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends, and \u201cseed\u201d sites, which require little or no 3\u2032 pairing support. Targets in the second category, \u201c3\u2032 compensatory\u201d sites, have weak 5\u2032 base-pairing and depend on strong compensatory pairing to the 3\u2032 end of the miRNA. We present evidence that all of these site types are used to mediate regulation by miRNAs and show that the 3\u2032 compensatory class of target sites is used to discriminate among individual members of miRNA families in vivo. A genome-wide statistical analysis allows us to estimate that an average miRNA has approximately 100 evolutionarily conserved target sites, indicating that miRNAs regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes. Evaluation of 3\u2032 pairing quality suggests that seed sites are the largest group. Sites of this type have been largely overlooked in previous target prediction methods.\n\nResults\nThe Minimal miRNA Target Site\nTo improve our understanding of the minimal requirements for a functional miRNA target site, we made use of a simple in vivo assay in the Drosophila wing imaginal disc. We expressed a miRNA in a stripe of cells in the central region of the disc and assessed its ability to repress the expression of a ubiquitously transcribed enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) transgene containing a single target site in its 3\u2032 UTR. The degree of repression was evaluated by comparing EGFP levels in miRNA-expressing and adjacent non-expressing cells. Expression of the miRNA strongly reduced EGFP expression from transgenes containing a single functional target site (Figure 1A).\n\nFigure 1 Complementarity to the miRNA 5\u2032 End Is Important for Target Site Function In Vivo\n(A) In vivo assay for target site regulation in the wing imaginal disc. The EGFP reporter is expressed in all cells (green). Cells expressing the miRNA under ptcGal4 control are shown in red. Functional target sites allow strong GFP repression by the miRNA (middle). Non-functional target sites do not (right). Yellow boxes indicate the disc region shown in (B) and later figures.\n\n(B) Regulation of individual target sites by miR-7. Numbers in the upper left of each image indicate the mismatched nucleotide in the target site. Positions important for regulation are shown in red, dispensable positions in green. Regulation by the miRNA is completely abolished in only a few cases.\n\n(C) Summary of the magnitude of reporter gene repression for the series in (B) and for a second set involving miR-278 and a target site resembling the miR-9 site in Lyra [26]. Positions important for regulation are shown in red, dispensable positions in green. Error bars are based on measurements of 3\u20135 individual discs.\n\nIn a first series of experiments we asked which part of the RNA duplex is most important for target regulation. A set of transgenic flies was prepared, each of which contained a different target site for miR-7 in the 3\u2032 UTR of the EGFP reporter construct. The starting site resembled the strongest bantam miRNA site in its biological target hid [19] and conferred strong regulation when present in a single copy in the 3\u2032 UTR of the reporter gene (Figure 1B). We tested the effects of introducing single nucleotide changes in the target site to produce mismatches at different positions in the duplex with the miRNA (note that the target site mismatches were the only variable in these experiments). The efficient repression mediated by the starting site was not affected by a mismatch at positions 1, 9, or 10, but any mismatch in positions 2 to 8 strongly reduced the magnitude of target regulation. Two simultaneous mismatches introduced into the 3\u2032 region had only a small effect on target repression, increasing reporter activity from 10% to 30%. To exclude the possibility that these findings were specific for the tested miRNA sequence or duplex structure, we repeated the experiment with miR-278 and a different duplex structure. The results were similar, except that pairing of position 8 was not important for regulation in this case (Figure 1C). Moreover, some of the mismatches in positions 2\u20137 still allowed repression of EGFP expression up to 50%. Taken together, these observations support previous suggestions that extensive base-pairing to the 5\u2032 end of the miRNA is important for target site function [26,27,29,32,34].\n\nWe next determined the minimal 5\u2032 sequence complementarity necessary to confer target regulation. We refer to the core of 5\u2032 sequence complementarity essential for target site recognition as the \u201cseed\u201d (Lewis et al. [27]). All possible 6mer, 5mer, and 4mer seeds complementary to the first eight nucleotides of the miRNA were tested in the context of a site that allowed strong base-pairing to the 3\u2032 end of the miRNA (Figure 2A). The seed was separated from a region of complete 3\u2032 end pairing by a constant central bulge. 5mer and 6mer seeds beginning at positions 1 or 2 were functional. Surprisingly, as few as four base-pairs in positions 2\u20135 conferred efficient target regulation under these conditions, whereas bases 1\u20134 were completely ineffective. 4mer, 5mer, or 6mer seeds beginning at position 3 were less effective. These results suggest that a functional seed requires a continuous helix of at least 4 or 5 nucleotides and that there is some position dependence to the pairing, since sites that produce comparable pairing energies differ in their ability to function. For example, the first two duplexes in Figure 2A (4mer, top row) have identical 5\u2032 pairing energies (\u0394G for the first 8 nt was \u22128.9 kcal/mol), but only one is functional. Similarly, the third 4mer duplex and fourth 5mer duplex (middle row) have the same energy (\u22128.7 kcal/mol), but only one is functional. We thus do not find a clear correlation between 5\u2032 pairing energy and function, as reported in [34]. These experiments also indicate that extensive 3\u2032 pairing of up to 17 nucleotides in the absence of the minimal 5\u2032 element is not sufficient to confer regulation. Consequently, target searches based primarily on optimizing the extent of base-pairing or the total free energy of duplex formation will include many non-functional target sites [28,30,35], and ranking miRNA target sites according to overall complementarity or free energy of duplex formation might not reflect their biological activity [26,27,28,30,35].\n\nFigure 2 The Minimal miRNA Target Site\n(A) In vivo tests of the function of target sites with 6mer, 5mer, and 4mer seeds complementary to the first eight nucleotides of the miRNA. Sites were designed to have optimal support from 3\u2032 pairing. The first 4mer seed site shows that extensive complementarity to the miRNA 3\u2032 region is not sufficient for regulation in vivo.\n\n(B) Regulation of 8mer, 7mer, and 6mer seed sites lacking complementarity to the miRNA 3\u2032 end. The test UTR contained one site (first column) or two identical sites (second column).\n\nTo determine the minimal lengths of 5\u2032 seed matches that are sufficient to confer regulation alone, we tested single sites that pair with eight, seven, or six consecutive bases to the miRNA's 5\u2032 end, but that do not pair to its 3\u2032 end (Figure 2B). Surprisingly, a single 8mer seed (miRNA positions 1\u20138) was sufficient to confer strong regulation by the miRNA. A single 7mer seed (positions 2\u20138) was also functional, although less effective. The magnitude of regulation for 8mer and 7mer seeds was strongly increased when two copies of the site were introduced in the UTR. In contrast, 6mer seeds showed no regulation, even when present in two copies. Comparable results were recently reported for two copies of an 8mer site with limited 3\u2032 pairing capacity in a cell-based assay [34]. These results do not support a requirement for a central bulge, as suggested previously [29].\n\nWe took care in designing the miRNA 3\u2032 ends to exclude any 3\u2032 pairing to nearby sequence according to RNA secondary structure prediction. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that extensive looping of the UTR sequence might allow the 3\u2032 end to pair to sequences further downstream in our reporter constructs. Note, however, that even if remote 3\u2032 pairing was occurring and required for function of 8- and 7mer seeds, it is not sufficient for 5\u2032 matches with less than seven complementary bases (all test sites are in the same sequence context; Figure 2B). In addition, pairing at a random level will occur in any sequence if long enough loops are allowed. However, whether the ribonucleoprotein complexes involved in translational repression require 3\u2032 pairing, and whether they are able to allow extensive looping to achieve this, remains an open question. Computationally, remote 3\u2032 pairing cannot be distinguished from random matches if loops of any length are allowed. On this basis any site with a 7- or 8mer seed has to be taken seriously\u2014especially when evolutionarily conserved.\n\nFrom these experiments we conclude that (1) complementarity of seven or more bases to the 5\u2032 end miRNA is sufficient to confer regulation, even if the target 3\u2032 UTR contains only a single site; (2) sites with weaker 5\u2032 complementarity require compensatory pairing to the 3\u2032 end of the miRNA in order to confer regulation; and (3) extensive pairing to the 3\u2032 end of the miRNA is not sufficient to confer regulation on its own without a minimal element of 5\u2032 complementarity.\n\nThe Effect of G:U Base-Pairs and Bulges in the Seed\nSeveral confirmed miRNA target genes contain predicted binding sites with seeds that are interrupted by G:U base-pairs or single nucleotide bulges [17,19,26,36,37,38,39]. In most cases these mRNAs contain multiple predicted target sites and the contributions of individual sites have not been tested. In vitro tests have shown that sites containing G:U base-pairs can function [29,34], but that G:U base-pairs contribute less to target site function than would be expected from their contribution to the predicted base-pairing energy [34]. We tested the ability of single sites with seeds containing G:U base-pairs and bulges to function in vivo. One, two, or three G:U base-pairs were introduced into single target sites with 8mer, 7mer, or 6mer seeds (Figure 3A). A single G:U base-pair caused a clear reduction in the efficiency of regulation by an 8mer seed site and by a 7mer seed site. The site with a 6mer seed lost its activity almost completely. Having more than one G:U base-pair compromised the activity of all the sites. As the target sites were designed to allow optimal 3\u2032 pairing, we conclude that G:U base-pairs in the seed region are always detrimental.\n\nFigure 3 Effects of G:U Base-Pairs and Bulges\n(A) Regulation of sites with 8mer, 7mer, or 6mer seeds (rows) containing zero, one, two, or three G:U base-pairs in the seed region (columns).\n\n(B) Regulation of sites with bulges in the target sequence or in the miRNA.\n\nSingle nucleotide bulges in the seed are found in the let-7 target lin-41 and in the lin-4 target lin-14 [17,36,37]. Recent tissue culture experiments have led to the proposal that such bulges are tolerated if positioned symmetrically in the seed region [29]. We tested a series of sites with single nucleotide bulges in the target or the miRNA (Figure 3B). Only some of these sites conferred good regulation of the reporter gene. Our results do not support the idea that such sites depend on a symmetrical arrangement of base-pairs flanking the bulge. We also note that the identity of the bulged nucleotide seems to matter. While it is clear that some target sites with one nucleotide bulge or a single mismatch can be functional if supported by extensive complementarity to the miRNA 3\u2032 end, it is not possible to generalize about their potential function.\n\nFunctional Categories of Target Sites\nWhile recognizing that there is a continuum of base-pairing quality between miRNAs and target sites, the experiments presented above suggest that sites that depend critically on pairing to the miRNA 5\u2032 end (5\u2032 dominant sites) can be distinguished from those that cannot function without strong pairing to the miRNA 3\u2032 end (3\u2032 compensatory sites). The 3\u2032 compensatory group includes seed matches of four to six base-pairs and seeds of seven or eight bases that contain G:U base-pairs, single nucleotide bulges, or mismatches.\n\nWe consider it useful to distinguish two subgroups of 5\u2032 dominant sites: those with good pairing to both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the miRNA (canonical sites) and those with good 5\u2032 pairing but with little or no 3\u2032 pairing (seed sites). We consider seed sites to be those where there is no evidence for pairing of the miRNA 3\u2032 end to nearby sequences that is better than would be expected at random. We cannot exclude the possibility that some sites that we identify as seed sites might be supported by additional long-range 3\u2032 pairing. Computationally, this is always possible if long enough loops in the UTR sequence are allowed. Whether long loops are functional in vivo remains to be determined.\n\nCanonical sites have strong seed matches supported by strong base-pairing to the 3\u2032 end of the miRNA. Canonical sites can thus be seen as an extension of the seed type (with enhanced 3\u2032 pairing in addition to a sufficient 5\u2032 seed) or as an extension of the 3\u2032compensatory type (with improved 5\u2032 seed quality in addition to sufficient 3\u2032 pairing). Individually, canonical sites are likely to be more effective than other site types because of their higher pairing energy, and may function in one copy. Due to their lower pairing energies, seed sites are expected to be more effective when present in more than one copy. Figure 4 presents examples of the different site types in biologically relevant miRNA targets and illustrates their evolutionary conservation in multiple drosophilid genomes.\n\nFigure 4 Three Classes of miRNA Target Sites\nModel of canonical (left), seed (middle) and 3\u2032 compensatory (right) target sites. The upper diagram illustrates the mode of pairing between target site (upper line) and miRNA (lower line, color). Next down in each column are diagrams of the pattern of 3\u2032 UTR conservation. The vertical black bars show stretches of at least six nucleotides that are conserved in several drosophilid genomes. Target sites for miR-7, miR-4, and miR-10 are shown as colored horizontal bars beneath the UTR. Sites for other miRNAs are shown as black bars. Furthest down in each column the predicted structure of the duplex between the miRNA and its target site is shown; canonical base-pairs are marked with filled circles, G:U base-pairs with open circles. The sequence alignments show nucleotide conservation of these target sites in the different drosophilid species Nucleotides predicted to pair to the miRNA are shown in bold; nucleotides predicted to be unpaired are grey. Red asterisks indicate 100% sequence conservation; grey asterisks indicate conservation of base-pairing to the miRNA including G:U pairs. The additional sequence alignment for the miR-10 target site in Scr in Tribolium castanaeum, Anopheles gambiae, and Bombyx mori strengthens this prediction. Note that the reduced quality of 3\u2032 compensation in these species is compensated by the presence of a better quality 7mer seed. A. ga, Anopheles gambiae; B. mo, B. mori; D. an, D. ananassae; D. me, D. melanogaster; D. ps, D. pseudoobscura; D. si, D. simulans; D. vi, D. virilis; D. ya, D. yakuba; T. ca, T. castanaeum.\n\n\nMost currently identified miRNA target sites are canonical. For example, the hairy 3\u2032 UTR contains a single site for miR-7, with a 9mer seed and a stretch of 3\u2032 complementarity. This site has been shown to be functional in vivo [26], and it is strikingly conserved in the seed match and in the extent of complementarity to the 3\u2032 end of miR-7 in all six orthologous 3\u2032 UTRs.\n\nAlthough seed sites have not been previously identified as functional miRNA target sites, there is some evidence that they exist in vivo. For example, the Bearded (Brd) 3\u2032 UTR contains three sequence elements, known as Brd boxes, that are complementary to the 5\u2032 region of miR-4 and miR-79 [32,40]. Brd boxes have been shown to repress expression of a reporter gene in vivo, presumably via miRNAs, as expression of a Brd 3\u2032 UTR reporter is elevated in dicer-1 mutant cells, which are unable to produce any miRNAs [14]. All three Brd box target sites consist of 7mer seeds with little or no base-pairing to the 3\u2032 end of either miR-4 or miR-79 (see below). The alignment of Brd 3\u2032 UTRs shows that there is little conservation in the miR-4 or miR-79 target sites outside the seed sequence, nor is there conservation of pairing to either miRNA 3\u2032 end. This suggests that the sequences that could pair to the 3\u2032 end of the miRNAs are not important for regulation as they do not appear to be under selective pressure. This makes it unlikely that a yet unidentified Brd box miRNA could form a canonical site complex.\n\nThe 3\u2032 UTR of the HOX gene Sex combs reduced (Scr) provides a good example of a 3\u2032 compensatory site. Scr contains a single site for miR-10 with a 5mer seed and a continuous 11-base-pair complementarity to the miRNA 3\u2032 end [28]. The miR-10 transcript is encoded within the same HOX cluster downstream of Scr, a situation that resembles the relationship between miR-iab-5p and Ultrabithorax in flies [26] and miR-196/HoxB8 in mice [41]. The predicted pairing between miR-10 and Scr is perfectly conserved in all six drosophilid genomes, with the only sequence differences occurring in the unpaired loop region. The site is also conserved in the 3\u2032 UTR of the Scr genes in the mosquito, Anopheles gambiae, the flour beetle, Tribolium castaneum, and the silk moth,Bombyx mori. Conservation of such a high degree of 3\u2032 complementarity over hundreds of millions of years of evolution suggests that this is likely to be a functional miR-10 target site. Extensive 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 sequence conservation is also seen for other 3\u2032 compensatory sites, e.g., the two let-7 sites in lin-41 or the miR-2 sites in grim and sickle [17,26,36].\n\nThe miRNA 3\u2032 End Determines Target Specificity within miRNA Families\nSeveral families of miRNAs have been identified whose members have common 5\u2032 sequences but differ in their 3\u2032 ends. In view of the evidence that 5\u2032 ends of miRNA are functionally important [26,27,29,42], and in some cases sufficient (present study), it can be expected that members of miRNA families may have redundant or partially redundant functions. According to our model, 5\u2032 dominant canonical and seed sites should respond to all members of a given miRNA family, whereas 3\u2032 compensatory sites should differ in their sensitivity to different miRNA family members depending on the degree of 3\u2032 complementarity. We tested this using the wing disc assay with 3\u2032 UTR reporter transgenes and overexpression constructs for various miRNA family members.\n\n\nmiR-4 and miR-79 share a common 5\u2032 sequence that is complementary to a single 8mer seed site in the bagpipe 3\u2032 UTR (Figure 5A and 5B). The 3\u2032 ends of the miRNAs differ. miR-4 is predicted to have 3\u2032 pairing at approximately 50% of the maximally possible level (\u221210.8 kcal/mol), whereas the level of 3\u2032 pairing for miR-79 is approximately 25% maximum (\u22126.1 kcal/mol), which is below the average level expected for random matches (see below). Both miRNAs repressed expression of the bagpipe 3\u2032 UTR reporter, regardless of the 3\u2032 complementarity (Figure 5B). This indicates that both types of site are functional in vivo and suggests that bagpipe is a target for both miRNAs in this family.\n\nFigure 5 Target Specificity of miRNA Family Members\n(A) Diagrams of 3\u2032 UTR conservation in six drosophilid genomes (horizontal black bars) and the location of predicted miRNA target sites. Above is the 3\u2032 UTR of the myogenic transcription factor bagpipe (bap) showing the predicted target site for the Brd box miRNA family, miR-4 and miR-79 (black box below the UTR). Alignment of miR-4 and miR-79 illustrates that they share a similar seed sequence (except that mir-4 has one extra 5\u2032 base) but have little 3\u2032 end similarity. Below are the conserved sequences in the3\u2032 UTRs of the pro-apoptotic genes grim and sickle. Predicted target sites for the K Box miRNAs miR-11, miR-2b, and miR-6 are shown below the UTR. Alignment of miR-11, miR-2b, and miR-6 illustrates that they share the same family motif but have little similarity in their 3\u2032 ends.\n\n(B) The bagpipe (bap) 3\u2032 UTR reporter gene is regulated by miR-4 and miR-79. Alignments of the two miRNAs to the predicted target site show good 8mer seed matches (left). Overexpression of miR-4 or miR-79 under ptcGal4 control downregulated the bagpipe 3\u2032 UTR reporter (right).\n\n(C) Left: Alignment of K box miRNAs with the single predicted site in the grim 3\u2032 UTR and regulation by overexpression of miR-2 (top), but not by miR-6 (middle) or miR-11 (bottom). Right: Alignment of K box miRNAs with the two predicted sites in the sickle 3\u2032 UTR. Regulation by overexpression of miR-2 was strong (top), regulation by miR-6 was weaker (middle), and miR-11 had little effect (bottom).\n\n(D) Effect of clones of cells lacking dicer-1 on expression of UTR reporters for predicted miRNA-regulated genes. Mutant cells were marked by the absence of \u03b2-Gal expression (red). EGFP expression is shown in green. Both channels are shown separately below in black and white. Mutant clones are indicated by yellow arrows. Expression of a uniformly transcribed reporter construct lacking miRNA target sites was unaffected in dicer-1 mutant cells (first column). The UTR reporter for the bantam miRNA target hid was upregulated in the mutant cells (second column). The bagpipe (bap) UTR reporter was upregulated in dicer-1 clones (third column). The grim (fourth column) and sickle (fifth column) UTR reporters were upregulated.\n\nTo test whether miRNA family members can also have non-overlapping targets, we used 3\u2032 UTR reporters of the pro-apoptotic genes grim and sickle, two recently identified miRNA targets [26]. Both genes contain K boxes in their 3\u2032 UTRs that are complementary to the 5\u2032 ends of the miR-2, miR-6, and miR-11 miRNA family [26,32]. These miRNAs share residues 2\u20138 but differ considerably in their 3\u2032 regions (Figure 5A). The site in the grim 3\u2032 UTR is predicted to form a 6mer seed match with all three miRNAs (Figure 5C, left), but only miR-2 shows the extensive 3\u2032 complementarity that we predict would be needed for a 3\u2032 compensatory site with a 6mer seed to function (\u221219.1 kcal/mol, 63% maximum 3\u2032 pairing, versus \u221210.9 kcal/mol, 46% maximum, for miR-11 and \u22128.7 kcal/mol, 37% maximum, for miR-6). Indeed, only miR-2 was able to regulate the grim 3\u2032 UTR reporter, whereas miR-6 and miR-11 were non-functional.\n\nThe sickle 3\u2032 UTR contains two K boxes and provides an opportunity to test whether weak sites can function synergistically. The first site is similar to the grim 3\u2032 UTR in that it contains a 6mer seed for all three miRNAs but extensive 3\u2032 complementarity only to miR-2. The second site contains a 7mer seed for miR-2 and miR-6 but only a 6mer seed for miR-11 (Figure 5C, right). miR-2 strongly downregulated the sickle reporter, miR-6 had moderate activity (presumably via the 7mer seed site), and miR-11 had nearly no activity, even though the miRNAs were overexpressed. The fact that a site is targeted by at least one miRNA argues that it is accessible (e.g., miR-2 is able to regulate both UTR reporters), and that the absence of regulation for other family members is due to the duplex structure. These results are in line with what we would expect based on the predicted functionality of the individual sites, and indicate that our model of target site functionality can be extended to UTRs with multiple sites. Weak sites that do not function alone also do not function when they are combined.\n\nTo show that endogenous miRNA levels regulate all three 3\u2032 UTR reporters, we compared EGFP expression in wild-type cells and dicer-1 mutant cells, which are unable to produce miRNAs [14]. dicer-1 clones did not affect a control reporter lacking miRNA binding sites, but showed elevated expression of a reporter containing the 3\u2032 UTR of the previously identified bantam miRNA target hid (Figure 5D). Similarly, all 3\u2032 UTR reporters above were upregulated in dicer-1 mutant cells, indicating that bagpipe, sickle, and grim are subject to repression by miRNAs expressed in the wing disc. Taken together, these experiments indicate that transcripts with 5\u2032 dominant canonical and seed sites are likely to be regulated by all members of a miRNA family. However, transcripts with 3\u2032 compensatory sites can discriminate between miRNA family members.\n\nGenome-Wide Occurrence of Target Sites\nExperimental tests such as those presented above and the observed evolutionary conservation suggest that all three types of target sites are likely to be used in vivo. To gain additional evidence we examined the occurrence of each site type in all Drosophila melanogaster 3\u2032 UTRs. We made use of the D. pseudoobscura genome, the second assembled drosophilid genome, to determine the degree of site conservation for the three different site classes in an alignment of orthologous 3\u2032 UTRs. From the 78 known Drosophila miRNAs, we selected a set of 49 miRNAs with non-redundant 5\u2032 sequences. We first investigated whether sequences complementary to the miRNA 5\u2032 ends were better conserved than would be expected for random sequences. For each miRNA, we constructed a cohort of ten randomly shuffled variants. To avoid a bias for the number of possible target matches, the shuffled variants were required to produce a number of sequence matches comparable (\u00b115%) to the original miRNAs for D. melanogaster 3\u2032 UTRs. 7mer and 8mer seeds complementary to real miRNA 5\u2032 ends were significantly better conserved than those complementary to the shuffled variants. This is consistent with the findings of Lewis et al. [27] but was obtained without the need to use a rank and energy cutoff applied to the full-length miRNA target duplex, as was the case for vertebrate miRNAs. Conserved 8mer seeds for real miRNAs occur on average 2.8 times as often as seeds complementary to the shuffled miRNAs (Figure 6A). For 7mer seeds this signal was 2:1, whereas 6mer, 5mer, and 4mer seeds did not show better conservation than expected for random sequences. To assess the validity of these signals and to control for the random shuffling of miRNAs, we repeated this procedure with \u201cmutant\u201d miRNAs in which two residues in the 5\u2032 region were changed. There was no difference between the mutant test miRNAs and their shuffled variants (Figure 6A). This indicates that a substantial fraction of the conserved 7mer and 8mer seeds complementary to real miRNAs identify biologically relevant target sites.\n\nFigure 6 Computational Analysis of Target Site Occurrence\n(A) Genome-wide occurrence of conserved 5\u2032 seed matches. Histogram showing the ratio of 5\u2032 seed matches for a set of 49 5\u2032 non-redundant miRNAs and the average of their ten completely shuffled variants for different seed types (black bars). A ratio of one (red line) indicates no difference between the miRNA and its shuffled variants. The same ratio for mutated miRNAs and their shuffled variants shows no signal (white bars). The inset depicts shuffling of the entire miRNA sequence (wavy purple line).\n\n(B) Target site conservation between D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura. Histogram showing the average conservation of the 3\u2032 UTR sequence (16 nt) upstream of a conserved 8mer seed match that would pair to the miRNA 3\u2032 end. All sites were binned according to their conservation, and the percentage of sites in each bin is shown for sites identified by 49 5\u2032 non-redundant miRNA sequences (grey) and their shuffled control sequences (black, error bars indicate one standard deviation).\n\n(C) 3\u2032 pairing preferences for miR-7 target sites. Histogram showing the distribution of 3\u2032 pairing energies for miR-7 (red bars) and the average of 50 3\u2032 shuffled variants (black bars) for all sites identified genome-wide by 6mer 5\u2032 seed matches for miR-7. The inset illustrates shuffling of the 3\u2032 end of miRNA sequence only (wavy purple line). Because the miRNA 5\u2032 end was not altered, the identical set of target sites was compared for pairing to the 3\u2032 end of real and shuffled miRNAs.\n\n(D) 3\u2032 pairing preferences for miRNA target sites. Histograms showing the ratio of the top 1% 3\u2032 pairing energies for the set of 58 3\u2032 non-redundant miRNAs and their shuffled variants. The y-axis shows the number of miRNAs for each ratio. Real miRNAs are shown in red; mutant miRNAs are shown in black. Left are shown combined 8- and 7mer seed sites. Right are shown combined 5- and 6mer seed sites. For combined 8- and 7mer seeds, 1% corresponds to approximately ten sites per miRNA; for combined 6- and 5mer, to approximately 25 sites. The difference between the real and mutated miRNAs improves if fewer sites per miRNA are considered.\n\n(E) Non-random signal of 3\u2032 pairing. Plot of the ratio of the number of target sites for the set of 58 3\u2032 non-redundant miRNAs and their shuffled miRNA 3\u2032 ends (y-axis) with 3\u2032 pairing energies that exceed a given pairing cutoff (x-axis). 100% is the pairing energy for a sequence perfectly complementary to the 3\u2032 end. As the required level of 3\u2032 pairing energy increases, fewer miRNAs and their sites remain to contribute to the signal. Plots for the real miRNAs extended to considerably higher 3\u2032 pairing energies than the mutants, but as site number decreases we observe anomalous effects on the ratios, so the curves were cut off when the number of remaining miRNAs fell below five.\n\n3\u2032 compensatory and canonical sites depend on substantial pairing to the miRNA 3\u2032 end. For these sites, we expect UTR sequences adjacent to miRNA 5\u2032 seed matches to pair better to the miRNA 3\u2032 end than to random sequences. However, unlike 5\u2032 complementarity, 3\u2032 base-pairing preference was not detected in previous studies looking at sequence complementarity and nucleotide conservation because UTR sequences complementary to the miRNA 3\u2032 end were not better conserved than would be expected at random [27].\n\nOn this basis, we decided to treat the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends of the miRNA separately. For the 5\u2032 end, seed matches were required to be fully conserved in an alignment of orthologous D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura 3\u2032 UTRs (we expected one-half to two-thirds of these matches to be real miRNA sites). We first investigated the overall conservation of UTR sequences adjacent to the conserved seed matches and found that overall the sequences are not better conserved than a random control with shuffled miRNAs (Figure 6B). For both real and random matches, the number of sites increases with the degree of 3\u2032 conservation (up to the 80% level), reflecting the increased probability that sequences adjacent to conserved seed matches will also lie in blocks of conserved sequence (Figure 6B). For real 7mers and 8mers we found a slightly higher percentage of sites between 30% and 80% identity than we did for the shuffled controls. In contrast, the ratio of sites with over 80% sequence identity was smaller for real 7- or 8mers than for random ones, meaning that in highly conserved 3\u2032 UTR blocks (>80% identity) the ratio of random matches exceeds that of real miRNA target sites. This caused us to question whether the degree of conservation for sequences adjacent to seed matches correlates with miRNA 3\u2032 pairing as would be expected if the conservation were due to a biologically relevant miRNA target site. Indeed, we found that the best conserved sites adjacent to seed matches (i.e., those with zero, one, or two mismatches in the 3\u2032 UTR alignment) and the least conserved sites (i.e., those with only three, two, or one matching nucleotides) are not distinguishable in that both pair only randomly to the corresponding miRNA 3\u2032 end (approximately 35% maximal 3\u2032 pairing energy, data not shown). The observation that miRNA target sites do not seem to be fully conserved over their entire length is consistent with the examples shown in Figure 4 in which only the degree of 3\u2032 pairing but not the nucleotide identity is conserved (miR-7/hairy), or at least the unpaired bulge is apparently not under evolutionary pressure (miR-10/Scr). Although this result obviously depends on the evolutionary distance of the species under consideration (see [43] for a comparison of mammalian sites), it shows that conclusions about the contribution of miRNA 3\u2032 pairing to target site function cannot be drawn solely from the degree of sequence conservation.\n\nWe therefore chose to evaluate the quality of 3\u2032 pairing by the stability of the predicted RNA\u2013RNA duplex. We assessed predicted pairing energy between the miRNA 3\u2032 end and the adjacent UTR sequence for both Drosophila species and used the lower score. Use of the lower score measures conservation of the overall degree of pairing without requiring sequence identity. Figure 6C shows the distribution of the 3\u2032 pairing energies for all conserved 3\u2032 compensatory miR-7 sites identified by a 6mer seed match, compared to the distribution of 50 miR-7 sequences shuffled only in the 3\u2032 part, leaving the 5\u2032 unchanged. This means that real and shuffled miRNAs identify the same 5\u2032 seed matches in the 3\u2032 UTRs, which allows us to compare the 3\u2032 pairing characteristics of the adjacent sequences. We also required 3\u2032 shuffled sequences to have similar pairing energies (\u00b115%) to their complementary sequences and to 10,000 randomly selected sites to exclude generally altered pairing characteristics. The distributions for real and shuffled miRNAs were highly similar, with a mean of approximately 35% of maximal 3\u2032 pairing energy and few sites above 55%. However, a small number of sites paired exceptionally well to miR-7 at energies that were far above the shuffled averages and not reached by any of the 50 shuffled controls. This example illustrates that there is a significant difference between real and shuffled miRNAs for the sites with the highest 3\u2032 complementarity, which are likely to be biologically relevant. Sites with weaker 3\u2032 pairing might also be functional, but cannot be distinguished from random matches and can only be validated by experiments (see Figure 5). To provide a global analysis of 3\u2032 pairing comprising all miRNAs and to investigate how many miRNAs show significantly non-random 3\u2032 pairing, we considered only the sites within the highest 1% of 3\u2032 pairing energies.\n\nThe average of the highest 1% of 3\u2032 pairing energies of each of 58 3\u2032 non-redundant miRNAs was divided by that of its 50 3\u2032 shuffled controls. This ratio is one if the averages are the same, and increases if the real miRNA has better 3\u2032 pairing than the shuffled miRNAs. To test whether a signal was specific for real miRNAs, we repeated the same protocol with a mutant version of each miRNA. The altered 5\u2032 sequence in the mutant miRNA selects different seed matches than the real miRNA and permits a comparison of sequences that have not been under selection for complementarity to miRNA 3\u2032 ends with those that may have been. Figure 6D shows the distribution of the energy ratios for canonical (left) and 3\u2032 compensatory sites (right) for all 58 real and mutated 3\u2032 non-redundant miRNAs. Most real miRNAs had ratios close to one, comparable to the mutants. But several had ratios well above those observed for mutant miRNAs, indicating significant conserved 3\u2032 pairing.\n\nA small fraction of sites show exceptionally good 3\u2032 pairing. If we use 3\u2032 pairing energy cutoffs to examine site quality for all miRNAs, we expect sites of this type to be distinguishable from random matches. The ratio of the number of sites above the cutoff for real versus 3\u2032 shuffled miRNAs was plotted as a function of the 3\u2032 pairing cutoff (Figure 6E). For low cutoffs the ratio is one, as the number of sites corresponds to the number of seed matches (which is identical for real and 3\u2032 shuffled miRNAs). For increasing cutoffs, the ratios increase once a certain threshold is reached, reflecting overrepresentation of sites that pair favorably to the real miRNA 3\u2032 end but not the 3\u2032 shuffled miRNAs. The maximal ratio obtained for mutated miRNAs never exceeded five, which we used as the threshold level to define where significant overrepresentation begins. For 8mer seed sites overrepresentation began at 55% maximal 3\u2032 pairing; for 7mer seed sites, at 65%; for 6mer seed sites, at 68%; and for 5mer seed sites, at 78%. There was no statistical evidence for sites with 4mer seeds.\n\nWe also tested whether sequences forming 7mer or 8mer seeds containing G:U base-pairs, mismatches, or bulges were better conserved if complementary to real miRNAs. We did not find any statistical evidence for these seed types. Analysis of 3\u2032 pairing also failed to show any non-random signal for these sites. This suggests that such sites are few in number genome-wide and are not readily distinguished from random matches. Nonetheless, our experiments do show that sites of this type can function in vivo. The let-7 sites in lin-41 provide a natural example.\n\nMost Sites Lack Substantial 3\u2032 Pairing\nThe experimental and computational results presented above provide information about 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 pairing that allows us to estimate the number of target sites of each type in Drosophila. The number of 3\u2032 compensatory sites cannot be estimated on the basis of 5\u2032 pairing, because seed matches of four, five, or six bases cannot be distinguished from random matches, reflecting that a large number of randomly conserved and non-functional matches predominate (Figure 6A). Significant 3\u2032 pairing can be distinguished from random matches for 6mer sites above 68% maximal 3\u2032 pairing energy, and above 78% for 5mers (Figure 6E). Using these pairing levels gives an estimate of one 3\u2032 compensatory site on average per miRNA. The experiments in Figure 5 provide an opportunity to assess the contribution of 3\u2032 pairing to the ability of sites with 6mer seeds to function. The 6mer K box site in the grim 3\u2032 UTR was regulated by miR-2 (63% maximal 3\u2032 pairing energy), but not by miR-11, which has a predicted 3\u2032 pairing energy of 46%. Similarly, the 6mer seed sites for miR-11 in the sickle 3\u2032 UTR had 3\u2032 pairing energies of approximately 35% and were non-functional. We can use the 63% and 46% levels to provide upper and lower estimates of one and 20 3\u2032 compensatory 6mer sites on average per miRNA. For 5mer sites, the examples in Figure 1 show that sites with 76% and 83% maximal 3\u2032 pairing do not function. At the 80% threshold level, we expect less than one additional site on average per miRNA, suggesting that 3\u2032 compensatory sites with 5mer seeds are rare. The predicted miR-10 site in Scr (see Figure 4) is one of the few sites with a 5mer seed that reaches this threshold (100% maximum 3\u2032 pairing energy; \u221220 kcal/mol). It is likely that other sites in this group will also prove to be functionally important.\n\nThe overrepresentation of conserved 5\u2032 seed matches (see Figure 6A) suggests that approximately two-thirds of sites with 8mer seeds and approximately one-half of the sites with 7mer seeds are biologically relevant. This corresponds to an average of 28 8mers and 53 7mers, for a total of 81 sites per miRNA. We define canonical sites as those with meaningful contributions from both 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 pairing. Given that 7- and 8mer seed matches can function without significant 3\u2032 pairing, it is difficult to assess at what level 3\u2032 pairing contributes meaningfully to their function. The range of 3\u2032 pairing energies that were minimally sufficient to support a weak seed match was between 46% and 63% of maximum pairing energy (see Figure 5C). If we take the 46% level as the lower limit for meaningful 3\u2032 pairing, over 95% of sites would be considered seed sites. This changes to 99% for pairing energies that can be statistically distinguished from noise (55% maximal; see Figure 6E) and remains over 50% even for pairing energies at the average level achieved by random matches (30% maximal). It is clear from this analysis that the majority of miRNA target sites lack substantial pairing in the 3\u2032 end in nearby sequences. Indeed the 3\u2032 pairing level for the three seed sites for miR-4 in Brd are all less than 25% (i.e., below the average for random matches) and Brd was thus not predicted as a miR-4 target previously [26,28,35].\n\nAgain, we note the caveat that some of sites that we identify as seed could in principle be supported by 3\u2032 pairing to more distant upstream sequences, but also that such sites would be difficult to distinguish from background computationally and that it is unclear whether large loops are functional. If there were statistical evidence for 3\u2032 pairing that is lower than would be expected at random for some sites, this would be one line of argument for a discrete functional class that does not use 3\u2032 pairing and would therefore suggest selection against 3\u2032 pairing. Although the overall distribution of 3\u2032 pairing energies for real miRNA 3\u2032 ends adjacent to 8mer seed matches is very similar to the random control with 3\u2032 shuffled sequences (Figure 7; R\n2 = 0.98), we observed a small but significant overrepresentation of real sites on both sides of the random distribution, which leads to a slightly wider distribution of real sites at the expense of the peak values around 30% pairing. Bearing in mind that one-third of 8mer seed matches are false positives (see Figure 6A), we can account for the noise by subtracting one-third of the random distribution. We then see two peaks at around 20% and 35% maximum pairing energy, separated by a dip. Subtracting more (e.g., one-half or two-thirds) of the random distribution increases the separation of the two peaks, suggesting that the underlying distribution of 3\u2032 pairing for real 8mer seed sites might indeed be bimodal. This effect is still present, though less pronounced, if 7mer seed matches are included. No such effect is seen for the combined 5- and 6mer seed matches. In addition, we see no difference between a random (noise) model that evaluates 3\u2032 pairing of 3\u2032 shuffled miRNAs to UTR sites identified by real miRNA seed matches and a random model that pairs the real (i.e., non-shuffled) miRNA 3\u2032 end to randomly chosen UTR sequences, thus excluding bias due to shuffling. Overall, these results suggest that there might indeed be a bimodal distribution due to an enrichment of sites with both better and worse 3\u2032 pairing than would be expected at random. We take this as evidence that seed sites are a biologically meaningful subgroup within the 5\u2032 dominant site category.\n\nFigure 7 Distribution of 3\u2032 Pairing Energies for 8mer Seed Matches\nShown is the distribution (number of sites versus 3\u2032 pairing) for 8mer seed matches identified genome-wide for 58 3\u2032 non-redundant miRNAs (black) compared to a random control using 50 3\u2032 shuffled miRNAs per real miRNA (grey). Note that the distribution for real miRNAs is broader at both the high and low end than the random control and has shoulders close to the peak. The red, blue, and green curves show the effect of subtracting background noise (random matches) from the real matches at three different levels, which reveals the real matches underlying these shoulders.\n\nOverall, these estimates suggest that there are over 80 5\u2032 dominant sites and 20 or fewer 3\u2032 compensatory sites per miRNA in the Drosophila genome. As estimates of the number of miRNAs in Drosophila range from 96 to 124 [44], this translates to 8,000\u201312,000 miRNA target sites genome-wide, which is close to the number of protein-coding genes. Even allowing for the fact that some genes have multiple miRNA target sites, these findings suggest that a large fraction of genes are regulated by miRNAs.\n\nDiscussion\nWe have provided experimental and computational evidence for different types of miRNA target sites. One key finding is that sites with as little as seven base-pairs of complementarity to the miRNA 5\u2032 end are sufficient to confer regulation in vivo and are used in biologically relevant targets. Genome-wide, 5\u2032 dominant sites occur 2- to 3-fold more often in conserved 3\u2032 UTR sequences than would be expected at random. The majority of these sites have been overlooked by previous miRNA target prediction methods because their limited capacity to base-pair to the miRNA 3\u2032 end cannot be distinguished from random noise. Such sites rank low in search methods designed to optimize overall pairing energy [16,17,26,27,28,30,35]. Indeed, we find that few seed sites scored high enough to be considered seriously in these earlier predictions, even when 5\u2032 complementarity was given an additional weighting (e.g., [28,43]. We thus suspect that methods with pairing cutoffs would exclude many, if not all, such sites.\n\nIn a scenario in which protein-coding genes acquire miRNA target sites in the course of evolution [4], it is likely that seed sites with only seven or eight bases complementary to a miRNA would be the first functional sites to be acquired. Once present, a site would be retained if it conferred an advantage, and sites with extended complementarity could also be selected to confer stronger repression. In this scenario, the number of sites might grow over the course of evolution so that ancient miRNAs would tend to have more targets than those more recently evolved. Likewise, genes that should not be repressed by the miRNA milieu in a given cell type would tend to avoid seed matches to miRNA 5\u2032 ends (\u201canti-targets\u201d [4]).\n\nAlthough a 7- to 8mer seed is sufficient for a site to function, additional 3\u2032 pairing increases miRNA functionality. The activity of a single 7mer canonical site is expected to be greater than an equivalent seed site. Likewise, the magnitude of miRNA-induced repression is reduced by introducing 3\u2032 mismatches into a canonical site. Genome-wide, there are many sites that appear to show selection for conserved 3\u2032 pairing and, interestingly, many sites that appear to show selection against 3\u2032 pairing. In vivo, canonical sites might function at lower miRNA concentrations and might repress translation more effectively, particularly when multiple sites are present in one UTR (e.g., [42]). Efficient repression is likely to be necessary for genes whose expression would be detrimental, as illustrated by the genetically identified miRNAs, which produce clear mutant phenotypes when their targets are not normally repressed (\u201cswitch targets\u201d [4]). Prolonged expression of the lin-14 and lin-41 genes in Caenorhabditis elegans mutant for lin-4 or let-7 causes developmental defects, and their regulation involves multiple sites [17,36,37]. Similarly, multiple target sites allow robust regulation of the pro-apoptotic gene hid by bantam miRNA in Drosophila [19]. More subtle modulation of expression levels could be accomplished by weaker sites, such as those lacking 3\u2032 pairing. Sites that cannot function efficiently alone are in fact a prerequisite for combinatorial regulation by multiple miRNAs. Seed sites might thus be useful for situations in which the combined input of several miRNAs is used to regulate target expression. Depending on the nature of the target sites, any single miRNA might not have a strong effect on its own, while being required in the context of others.\n\n3\u2032 Complementarity Distinguishes miRNA Family Members\n3\u2032 compensatory sites have weak 5\u2032 pairing and need substantial 3\u2032 pairing to function. We find genome-wide statistical support for 3\u2032 compensatory sites with 5mer and 6mer seeds and show that they are used in vivo. Furthermore, these sites can be differentially regulated by different miRNA family members depending on the quality of their 3\u2032 pairing (e.g., regulation of the pro-apoptotic genes grim and sickle by miR-2, miR-6, and miR-11). Thus, members of a miRNA family may have common targets as well as distinct targets. They may be functionally redundant in regulation of some targets but not others, and so we can expect some overlapping phenotypes as well as differences in their mutant phenotypes.\n\nFollowing this reasoning, it is likely that the let-7 miRNA family members differentially regulate lin-41 in C. elegans [17,45]. The seed matches in lin-41 to let-7 and the related miRNAs miR-48, miR-84, and miR-241 are weak, and only let-7 has strong 3\u2032 pairing. On this basis, it seems likely that lin-41 is regulated only by let-7. In contrast, hbl-1 has four sites with strong seed matches [38,39], and we expect it to be regulated by all four let-7 family members. As all four let-7-related miRNAs are expressed similarly during development [6], their role as regulators of hbl-1 may be redundant. let-7 must also have targets not shared by the other family members, as its function is essential. lin-41 is likely to be one such target.\n\nThe idea that the 3\u2032 end of miRNAs serves as a specificity factor provides an attractive explanation for the observation that many miRNAs are conserved over their full length across species separated by several hundreds of millions of years of evolution. 3\u2032 compensatory sites may have evolved from canonical sites by mutations that reduce the quality of the seed match. This could confer an advantage by allowing a site to become differentially regulated by miRNA family members. In addition, sites could retain specificity and overall pairing energy, but with reduced activity, perhaps permitting discrimination between high and low levels of miRNA expression. This might also allow a target gene to acquire a dependence on inputs from multiple miRNAs. These scenarios illustrate a few ways in which more complex regulatory roles for miRNAs might arise during evolution.\n\nA Large Fraction of the Genome Is Regulated by miRNAs\nAnother intriguing outcome of this study is evidence for a surprisingly large number of miRNA target sites genome-wide. Even our conservative estimate is far above the numbers of sites in recent predictions, e.g., seven or fewer per miRNA [27,28,29]. Our estimate of the total number of targets approaches the number of protein-coding genes, suggesting that regulation of gene expression by miRNAs plays a greater role in biology than previously anticipated. Indeed, Bartel and Chen [46] have suggested in a recent review that the earlier estimates were likely to be low, and a recent study by John et al. [43], published while this manuscript was under review, predicts that approximately 10% of human genes are regulated by miRNAs. We agree with these authors' suggestion that this is likely an underestimate, because their method identifies an average of only 7.1 target genes per miRNA, with few that we would classify as seed sites lacking substantial 3\u2032 pairing. A large number of target sites per miRNA is also consistent with combinatorial gene regulation by miRNAs, analogous to that by transcription factors, leading to cell-type-specific gene expression [47]. Sites for multiple miRNAs allow for the possibility of cell-type-specific miRNA combinations to confer robust and specific gene regulation.\n\nOur results provide an improved understanding of some of the important parameters that define how miRNAs bind to their target genes. We anticipate that these will be of use in understanding known miRNA\u2013target relationships and in improving methods to predict miRNA targets. We have limited our evaluation to target sites in 3\u2032 UTRs. miRNAs directed at other types of targets or with dramatically different functions (e.g., in regulation of chromatin structure) might well use different rules. Accordingly, there may prove to be more targets than we can currently estimate. Further, there may be additional features, such as overall UTR context, that either enhance or limit the accessibility of predicted sites and hence their ability to function. For example, the rules about target site structure cannot explain the apparent requirement for the linker sequence observed in the let-7/lin-41 regulation [48]. Further efforts toward experimental target site validation and systematic examination of UTR features can be expected to provide new insight into the function of miRNA target sites.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nFly strains\nptcGal4; EP miR278 was provided by Aurelio Teleman. The control, hid, grim, and sickle 3\u2032 UTR reporter transgenes, and UAS-miR-2b are described in [19,26]. For UAS constructs for miRNA overexpression, genomic fragments including miR-4 (together with miR-286 and miR-5) and miR-11 were amplified by PCR and cloned into UAS-DSred as described for UAS-miR-7 [26]. Details are available on request. UAS-miR-79 (also contains miR-9b and miR-9c) and UAS-miR-6 (miR-6\u20131, miR-6\u20132, and miR-6\u20133) were kindly provided by Eric Lai. dcr-1\nQ1147X is described in [14].\n\nClonal analysis\nClones mutant for dcr-1\nQ1147X were induced in HS-Flp;dcr-1 FRT82/armadillo-lacZ FRT82 larvae by heat shock for 1 h at 38 \u00b0C at 50\u201360 h of development. Wandering third-instar larvae were dissected and labeled with rabbit anti-GFP (Torrey Pines Biolabs, Houston, Texas, United States; 1:400) and anti-\u03b2-Gal (rat polyclonal, 1:500).\n\nReporter constructs\nThe bagpipe 3\u2032 UTR was PCR amplified from genomic DNA (using the following primers [enzyme sites in lower case]: AAtctaga\nAGGTTGGGAGTGACCATGTCTC and AActcgag\nTATTTAGCTCTCGGGTAGATACG) and cloned downstream of the tubulin promoter and EGFP (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States) in Casper4 as in [26].\n\n\nSingle target site constructs\nOligonucleotides containing the target site sequences shown in the figures were annealed and cloned downstream of tub>EGFP and upstream of SV40polyA (XbaI/XhoI). Clones were verified by DNA sequencing. Details are available on request.\n\nEGFP intensity measurements\nNIH image 1.63 was used to quantify intensity levels in miRNA-expressing and non-expressing cells from confocal images. Depending on the variation, between three and five individual discs were analyzed.\n\n3\u2032 UTR alignments\nFor each D. melanogaster gene, we identified the D. pseudoobscura ortholog using TBlastn as described in [26]. We then aligned the D. melanogaster 3\u2032 UTR obtained from the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project to the D. pseudoobscura 3\u2032 adjacent sequence (Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of Medicine) using AVID [49]. For individual examples, we manually mapped the D. melanogaster coding region to genomic sequence traces (National Center for Biotechnology Information trace archive) of D. ananassae, D. virilis, D. simulans, and D. yakuba by TBlastn and extended the sequences by Blastn-walking. These 3\u2032 UTR sequences were then aligned to the D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura 3\u2032 UTRs using AVID.\n\nmiRNA-sequences\nDrosophila miRNA sequences were from [44,50,51] downloaded from Rfam (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/index.shtml). The 5\u2032 non-redundant set (49 miRNAs) comprised bantam, let-7, miR-1, miR-10, miR-11, miR-100, miR-124, miR-125, miR-12, miR-133, miR-13a, miR-14, miR-184, miR-210, miR-219, miR-263b, miR-275, miR-276b, miR-277, miR-278, miR-279, miR-281, miR-283, miR-285, miR-287, miR-288, miR-303, miR-304, miR-305, miR-307, miR-309, miR-310, miR-314, miR-315, miR-316, miR-317, miR-31a, miR-33, miR-34, miR-3, miR-4, miR-5, miR-79, miR-7, miR-87, miR-8, miR-92a, miR-9a, and miR-iab-4\u20135p. Additional miRNAs in the 3\u2032 non-redundant set were miR-2b, miR-286, miR-306, miR-308, miR-311, miR-312, miR-313, miR-318, and miR-6.\n\n\nmiRNA shuffles and mutants\nFor the completely shuffled miRNAs, we shuffled the miRNA sequence over the entire length and required all possible 8mer and 7mer seeds within the first nine bases to have an equal frequency (\u00b115%) to the D. melanogaster 3\u2032 UTRs (i.e., same single genome count). For the 3\u2032 shuffled miRNAs, we shuffled the 3\u2032 end starting at base 10 and required the shuffles to have equal (\u00b115%) pairing energy to a perfect complement and to 10,000 randomly chosen sites. For each miRNA we created all possible 2-nt mutants (exchanging A to T or C, C to A or G, G to C or T, and T to A or G) within the seed (nucleotides 3\u20136) and chose the one with the closest alignment frequencies to the real miRNA in D. melanogaster 3\u2032 UTRs and in the conserved sequences in D. melanogaster and D. pseudoobscura 3\u2032 UTRs.\n\nSeed matching and site evaluation\nFor each miRNA and seed type we found the 5\u2032 match in the D. melanogaster 3\u2032 UTRs and required it to be 100% conserved in an alignment to the D. pseudoobscura ortholog allowing for positional alignment errors of \u00b12 nt. When searching 7mer to 4mer seeds we masked all longer seeds to avoid identifying the same site more than once. For each matching site we extracted the 3\u2032 adjacent sequence for both genomes, aligned it to the miRNA 3\u2032 end starting at nucleotide 10 using RNAhybrid [35], and took the worse energy.\n\nSupporting Information\nAccession Numbers\nThe miRNA sequences discussed in this paper can be found in the miRNA Registry (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/index.shtml).

In recent years, it's become increasingly clear that one class of molecules, called microRNAs (miRNAs), exert significant regulatory control over gene expression in most plant and animal species. A mere 22 nucleotides long, miRNAs control a cell's protein composition by preventing the translation of protein-coding messenger RNAs (mRNAs). When a miRNA pairs with an mRNA, through complementary base pairing between the molecules, the mRNA is either destroyed or is not translated.\n\nHundreds of miRNAs have been found in animals, but functions for just a few have been identified, mostly through genetic studies. Many more functions could be assigned if miRNA targets could be predicted. This approach has worked in plants, because miRNAs and their targets pair through the near perfect complementarity of their base pairs. But the molecules follow different rules in animals\u2014duplexes contain just short stretches of complementary sequence interrupted by gaps and mismatches\u2014which makes predicting miRNA targets a challenge.\n\nIn a new study, Stephen Cohen and his colleagues at the European Molecular Biological Laboratory in Germany establish basic ground rules for miRNA\u2013mRNA pairing using a combination of genetics and computational analyses, and identify different classes of miRNA targets with distinct functional properties. Although the miRNA is only 22 nucleotides long, its 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends seem to have distinct roles in binding. Cohen and colleagues show that miRNA functional targets can be divided into two broad categories: those that depend primarily on pairing to the miRNA's 5\u2032 end (called 5\u2032 dominant sites), with varying degrees of 3\u2032 pairing, and those that also need the miRNA's 3\u2032 end (called 3\u2032 compensatory sites). Surprisingly, miRNAs can regulate their targets simply by strong pairing with so-called seed sites that consist of just seven or eight bases complementary to the miRNA 5\u2032 end. Target sites with weaker 5\u2032 complementarity need supplemental pairing with the miRNA's 3\u2032 end to function. The finding that so little sequence complementarity is needed means that there are many more target sites than had been previously recognized.\n\nThe miRNA 3\u2032 end, while not essential, is expected to confer some function, since it tends to be conserved in animals\u2014miRNA 3\u2032 ends provide an additional measure of regulatory control by permitting the function of target sites that have only limited complementarity to the miRNA 5\u2032 end. The authors speculate that seed sites might be the first functional sites acquired by protein-coding genes that require repression, and that additional sites might be acquired to promote stronger repression.\n\nBased on their experimental results, Cohen and colleagues searched the Drosophila genome for biologically relevant targets, and estimate that the fly has about 100 sites for every miRNA in its genome. Since the fruitfly has anywhere from 96 to 124 miRNAs, that means it has 8,000 to 12,000 target sites (in the 11,000 genes sampled). This indicates that miRNAs regulate a large fraction of protein-coding genes. Of the known animal miRNAs, many regulate critical developmental processes. This new approach to predicting targets should help reveal just how much regulatory control actually flows from these tiny bits of RNA.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030114SynopsisBioinformatics/Computational BiologyCell BiologyGenetics/Genomics/Gene TherapyMolecular Biology/Structural BiologyEukaryotesDrosophilaSeeds of Dest...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1043861.txt"}

For many animals, too, tastes and smells are evocative and play a crucial role in finding food, allowing them to build on past successes and to learn how to find their next meal.\n\nTo locate blooming flowers, for example, honeybees rely heavily on scent. They can associate a whiff of an aldehyde, say, with a nectar-filled orchid. Then later they'll seek out the same or similar scents. To succeed in the wild, they must be able to distinguish relevant scents at varying concentrations, and within complex milieus of other scents. But to find food in varied conditions and adapt to new situations, they also have to generalize from past experience.\n\nThrough both physiological and behavioral studies, scientists have investigated the response to smell in a wide range of organisms and have suggested that two key properties of scent-inducing chemicals are the functional class, such as alcohol or aldehyde, and the carbon-chain length. Bees trained to associate a particular chemical with a reward, for example, can then generalize to some extent to other chemicals with the same functional groups or similar carbon-chain lengths. In these situations, bees are surprisingly consistent in both in their behavior (extending their proboscis to an odor previously associated with food) and in their brains (brain activity in smell-processing centers). Each set of data, behavioral and neural, can be thought of as a \u201ccode\u201d underlying the bee's response: present a scent, and a bee's brain and body will tend to react in a certain way.\n\n\nLinking smellperception and neural activity in the bee (Image: Axel Brockmann)\nA new study of smell perception in honeybees (Apis mellifera) published in PLoS Biology gives a more comprehensive picture of how bees react to a suite of scents and also shows a remarkable correspondence between the codes for the insects' behavior and brain activity. The researchers, led by Martin Giurfa, first trained bees to associate a specific chemical, such as the alcohol 1-nonanol, with a sucrose reward. Then the researchers tested the bees' response to a set of other chemicals, varying in carbon-chain length from six to nine, and with four different functional groups: aldehydes, ketones, and primary and secondary alcohols.\n\nBy watching how often the bees generalized\u2014that is, how often they responded positively to a particular scent when they'd been trained on another\u2014the researchers could assign perceptual \u201cdistances\u201d between pairs of chemicals. Drawing together all these distances, they created a preliminary map of the bees' \u201cperceptual space,\u201d similar to how surveyors measure distances between landmarks to map a landscape. From this comparison they found, for example, that the bees generalized more by functional group than by carbon-chain length.\n\nPreviously, Giovanni Galizia's group, which works closely with Giurfa's group, had recorded bees' brain responses to the same pairs of scents, assigning distances within centers of activity for each scent. Giurfa's team compared these two sets of data and found that the perceptual and neural distances correlated well, which suggests there's a species-specific code that ties together the insects' brain and behavior.\n\nThe brain recordings covered only a quarter of the bees' main smell-processing center, the antennal lobe. Future studies with new methods of microscopy that visualize more of the brain and which focus on the olfactory message sent by the antennal lobe to higher-order brain centers should only improve our ability to investigate the correlations between brain and behavior, the authors say. Such studies would go even further toward cracking the codes underlying animals' perception and memory.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030122SynopsisAnimal BehaviorNeuroscienceZoologyInsectsCracking the Olfactory Code Synopsis4 2005 22 2 2005 22 2 2005 3 4 e122Copyright: \u00a9 2005 Public Library of...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1043862.txt"}

Some hypotheses have been put forward to explain this widespread phenomenon and, up to now, only one fact has emerged clearly: In species in which meiosis is achiasmate in one sex, it is the heterogametic one. This pattern, known as the Haldane-Huxley rule, is thought to be a side effect, on autosomes, of the suppression of recombination between the sex chromosomes. However, this rule does not hold for heterochiasmate species (i.e., species in which recombination is present in both sexes but varies quantitatively between sexes) and does not apply to species lacking sex chromosomes, such as hermaphroditic plants. In this paper, we show that in plants, heterochiasmy is due to a male-female difference in gametic selection and is not influenced by the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosomes. This finding provides strong empirical support in favour of a population genetic explanation for the evolution of heterochiasmy and, more broadly, for the evolution of sex and recombination.\n\nMeasuring the opportunity for natural selection on gametes provides the first empirical evidence for a theory explaining why recombination at meiosis varies between males and females\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nSex differences in recombination were discovered in the first linkage studies on Drosophila [1,2] and Bombyx (Tanaka [1914] in [3]) almost one century ago. However, this observation remains today largely unexplained despite several attempts. Based on very limited observations (see Table 1), especially of Bombyx, in which the female is heterogametic, Haldane [3] suggested, as far as \u201cthese facts are anything more than a coincidence,\u201d that the lower autosomal recombination rate in the heterogametic sex may reflect a pleiotropic consequence of selection against recombination between the sex chromosomes. Later, Huxley [4] showed that Gammarus males also recombined less than females. He gave the same evolutionary explanation, although he restricted it to cases of a marked sex difference.\n\nTable 1 Data on Which the Haldane-Huxley Rule is Based\nListed are the data available to Haldane [4] when he proposed the Haldane-Huxley rule\n\n\na\u2009\nrm represents recombination in males\n\n\nb\u2009\nrf represents recombination in females\n\n\nc\u2009Plus and minus symbols indicate the direction of heterochiasmy, and zero indicates achiasmy\n\nThis conjecture has now been confirmed for achiasmate species (i.e., species in which only one sex recombines) and is referred to as Haldane-Huxley rule: Nei [5] showed theoretically that tight linkage should evolve on Y or W chromosomes, and Bell [6] compiled a large dataset showing that achiasmy evolved 29\u201334 times independently, each time with no recombination in the heterogametic sex.\n\nHowever, for heterochiasmate species, three problems with the Haldane-Huxley pleiotropy explanation were discovered [7,8]. The first problem arose when substantial variation in male-female differences in recombination rate was found between pairs of autosomes within mice [8] and Tribolium [9,10], and between genotypes for the same pair of autosomes [11]. The second problem was the discovery that hermaphrodite species (the platyhelminth Dendrocoelum [12] and the plant Allium [13]) may present strong heterochiasmy between male and female meiosis despite having no sex chromosomes or even sex-determining loci. The third problem was the discovery of species in which the heterogametic sex recombines more than the homogametic one (e.g., in some Triturus species) [14]. Because of these contradictory observations, variation in heterochiasmy has remained difficult to explain because of the absence of an alternative theory as well as the lack of a clear pattern in the data.\n\nIn 1969, Nei [5] worked out the first \u201cmodifier\u201d model to study the evolution of sex differences in recombination, and concluded for autosomes that \u201cthe evolutionary mechanism of these sex differences is not known at present.\u201d Surveying an updated dataset, Bell [6] concluded that \u201cfemale gametes experience more crossing over among hermaphroditic plants (and perhaps animals), but this is not invariably the case among gonochoric animals (\u2026) certainly (this) has never received any explanation.\u201d The idea that heterochiasmy may be explained by a sex rather than by a sex chromosome effect, which was ignored by Haldane because of Bombyx, was reconsidered. This led Trivers [15] to suggest that, because only males with very good gene combinations reproduce (relative to females, for whom reproduction success is often less variable), they should recombine less to keep intact these combinations. He accounted for exceptions by variation in the regime of sexual selection. The idea was criticized by Burt et al. [16], who also questioned the correlations\u2014with an updated dataset\u2014between heterochiasmy and either sex or heterogamety. These authors tried to correlate the level of heterochiasmy with the amount of \u201copportunity for sex-specific selection,\u201d but failed to find an effect. They were tempted to advocate neutrality, but were puzzled by the positive correlation between male and female recombination rate and by evidence showing compensation (e.g., female mice tend to recombine more on the X, as if they were compensating for no recombination in males; similarly, no species is known with achiasmy in both sexes [16]). In 1994, Korol et al. [17] insisted on a possible role for gametic selection but did not give evidence in favour of this claim. Recently, Lenormand [18], using Nei's modifier approach, showed that it is very difficult to explain heterochiasmy by sex-specific diploid selection. Rather, a sex difference in selection during haploid phase, or a sex difference in diploid selection on imprinted genes, is a more likely explanation. He predicted that, as far as haploid selection is concerned, the sex experiencing the more intense haploid selection should recombine less. Indeed, when allelic effects interact to determine fitness (i.e., when there is \u201cepistasis,\u201d either negative or positive), recombining decreases mean fitness in the population of the next generation [19]. This effect occurs because recombination breaks up combinations of genes that have previously been built up by selection. For a given average recombination rate between sexes and for a given average epistasis between male and female haploids, it is always advantageous for the haploid population (male or female) with the greatest absolute value in epistasis to be produced with the lowest amount of recombination. In this way, the \u201crecombination load\u201d that the haploid population is exposed to is minimized.\n\nIn this paper, we would like to come up with a more quantitative evaluation of the possible role of haploid selection in shaping heterochiasmy. For that purpose, we first updated the dataset of Burt et al. [16] on heterochiasmy, focusing on genetic maps that have become available over the last 15 years. We then determined how fast heterochiasmy evolves, in order to measure the amount of phylogenetic inertia on this trait. Finally, we determined whether variables such as gender, heterogamety, or the opportunity for selection in the haploid phase, could explain variation in heterochiasmy. If there is selection with substantial epistasis on some genes during the haploid phase, we expect the sex with the greater opportunity for haploid selection to show less recombination. Alternatively, if selection during the haploid phase is weak or without substantial epistasis, we do not expect it to produce a directional bias in the amount of recombination displayed by either sex.\n\nResults/Discussion\nSex Chromosomes\nHeterochiasmy is a fast-evolving trait, and phylogenetic inertia does not satisfactorily explain its distribution. In contrast to achiasmy, we found that heterochiasmy is not influenced by the nature of the sex chromosomes. This is interesting, because it suggests that achiasmy and heterochiasmy are influenced by qualitatively different evolutionary forces, although they seem to differ only quantitatively. It would be useful to determine whether achiasmy evolved to reduce the average recombination rate or to change the relative amount of recombination between the sexes. The two situations may be discriminated by determining whether the homogametic sex in achiasmate species tends to recombine more than in closely related chiasmate species. Evidence for such compensation would indicate that achiasmy did not evolve to reduce the average recombination rate. In the absence of such compensation, however, achiasmy may simply reflect selection for tight linkage. In such a situation, we propose that Haldane-Huxley rule may be caused by the converse argument to the one previously considered: The presence of achiasmy only in the heterogametic sex may reflect selection to maintain nonzero recombination rate on X or Z chromosomes in the homogametic sex. In species in which the average autosomal recombination rate is selected against (i.e., towards a lower equilibrium value), loss-of-function (recombination) mutations with an effect restricted to one sex may spread only if they affect the heterogametic sex, because mutations suppressing recombination in the homogametic sex completely suppress recombination on the X or Z chromosome. The same argument applies to XO species and may explain why achiasmy is associated only with the heterogametic sex. In addition, this hypothesis does not require the existence of genes suppressing recombination between the sex chromosomes with autosomal pleiotropic effects. Under this hypothesis, there is no reason to find an effect of the presence of heteromorphic sex chromosome on the amount of heterochiasmy, as originally envisioned by Haldane and Huxley. Overall, this hypothesis would explain why heterochiasmy and achiasmy differ qualitatively and why we do not observe any effect of sex chromosomes on heterochiasmy.\n\nHeterochiasmy in Animals\nIn animals, male-female dimorphism in haploid selection may also contribute to heterochiasmy. In general, there is no female haploid phase in animals, because meiosis is completed only at fertilisation. As far as at least some genes are expressed and under selection during the male haploid phase, this would tend to bias towards tighter linkage in males. Sets of genes responsible for male-specific meiotic drive systems would be good candidates and are often found in tight linkage. Measuring the opportunity for haploid selection in animals may be possible within some groups. Imprinting may, however, act as a confounding effect in many groups of animals while trying to measure the opportunity for \u201chaploid\u201d selection. Within-species comparisons of imprinted regions or of regions with sex-specific recombination using high-resolution maps [20] may be more fruitful to discriminate among potential causes of heterochiasmy in animals. In particular, there is evidence in humans that the reduction in crossing-over associated with imprinting is in the direction that theory predicts, even if this pattern is consistent with other explanations [21]. Finally, understanding exceptions within groups (e.g., male marsupials, contrarily to most mammals, recombine more than females of the species [22]) may also shed light on the different hypotheses.\n\nHeterochiasmy in Plants\nWe found that plant heterochiasmy is correlated with the opportunity for male and female haploid selection. Female meiosis tends to exhibit lower recombination rates relative to male meiosis when selection is intense among female gametophytes (e.g., in Pinaceae) or mild among male gametophytes (e.g., in highly selfing species). This pattern is expected if heterochiasmy is determined by the relative magnitude of haploid selection in male and female individuals. Finding a pattern consistent with this general population genetic prediction is, of course, not firm evidence that male-female dimorphism in haploid selection is the evolutionary force generating heterochiasmy. Other correlates of selfing rates might have to be closely examined [23]. However, we consider this explanation the most parsimonious so far. Our finding provides, therefore, the first empirical evidence for a theory explaining male-female differences in the amount of recombination and contributes to our understanding of contradictory observations that have puzzled geneticists for almost a century. It also indicates that the amount of recombination may be shaped by indirect selection, and, therefore, corroborates theories based on selection and variation for the evolution of sexual reproduction.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAn extended dataset\nWe measured heterochiasmy as the log of the male/-to-female ratio (\u03c1) of autosomal recombination rate measured either with chiasma number or map length. We log-transformed the ratio to avoid bias due to measurement error in the denominator. Chiasma-count data for different species were compiled by Burt et al. [16], and we used their dataset, adding a few recent studies. We compiled genetic map data and linkage studies in animals and plants for which both a male and a female map were available. Only homologous fragments (i.e., between shared markers) in male and female maps were considered (especially in low-resolution maps). Heterochiasmy data were available for 107 species, with 46 sets of data based on genomic maps (Table 2).\n\nTable 2 Dataset Pooled by Species with Levels of Phylogenetic Grouping Used in the Analysis\nNote that references given in Burt et al.

In the same way, heterochiasmy may be so variable between genotypes within a species that it may be difficult to measure and irrelevant to analyse species specific effects. In order to get a picture of phylogenetic inertia on heterochiasmy, we estimated the phylogenetic autocorrelation of \u03c1 using Moran's I spatial autocorrelation statistic [24]. When standardized, values of Moran's I vary from \u22121 to 1. Positive values indicate that heterochiasmy is more similar than random within a taxonomic level, whereas negative values indicate that it is more different. Because a few species had multiple estimates of heterochiasmy, we also estimated the within-species correlation. The resulting correlogram is shown in Figure 1. We found that heterochiasmy is a fast-evolving trait: Genotypes tend to be correlated within a species (I/Imax = 0.38, p = 7.9%), but this correlation is lower among species within genera (I/Imax = 0.18, P-value = 13%), and very low when comparing genera within families (I/Imax = 0.039, p = 63%). This pattern is very different from the one observed for highly autocorrelated traits using the same method (for instance, mammalian body size [25]). This analysis indicates that there is very little phylogenetic inertia overall on heterochiasmy, but that the species level is appropriate for our dataset. However, this low level of inertia may nevertheless inflate type-I error while testing the effect of independent variables on heterochiasmy. In order to avoid this problem, we tested the association between different variables and heterochiasmy using a generalized estimating equations linear model correcting for the full phylogeny (see below) [26].\n\nFigure 1 Phylogenetic Correlogram of Heterochiasmy and Selfing Rate\nThe y-axis represents Moran's I rescaled to enable comparisons between each taxonomic level for heterochiasmy (\u03c1, solid line) and selfing rate (Vm, dashed line). The x-axis represents the taxonomic level: /S is the correlation within species, S/G is the correlation of species within genera, etc. F, family; O, order; C, class; P, phylum; K, kingdom. Filled points indicate significance at p = 0.05.\n\nSex chromosome effect\nFor each species, we reported the presence of sex chromosomes. We defined the variable Vsc with the following values: \u22121 for XY/XX species, \u22121/2 for XO/XX or XY/XX without pseudoautosomal regions (marsupials), 0 for species without sex-chromosomes, and +1 for ZZ/ZW species. We distinguished the \u22121 and \u22121/2 cases to reflect the fact that, in the latter, recombination does not occur between sex chromosomes, so we expect a lower current selection pressure to suppress recombination. Under the Haldane-Huxley hypothesis, the presence of sex chromosomes is supposed to favour reduced recombination rate in the heterogametic sex. We therefore expect a positive effect of the variable Vsc on \u03c1. We did not find such an effect in animals or plants (the linear effect of Vsc on \u03c1 is not significantly different from zero [p = 0.75 in animals and p = 0.52 in plants], assuming species were independent), and this result is unchanged if the \u22121 and \u22121/2 cases are not distinguished. Given this negative result, there was no need to do a phylogenetic correction.\n\nGametic selection\nIn animals from our dataset, there is no female haploid phase because the completion of meiosis occurs only at fertilisation (sperm triggers the end of meiosis). In male gametes, very few genes are expressed, and sperm phenotype is determined mostly either by the diploid genotype of the paternal tissue or by its mitochondrial genome. Imprinted genes, which can also affect the evolution of heterochiasmy [18,21], may be as numerous as haploid-expressed genes and act as a confounding factor while evaluating the \u201copportunity\u201d for male or female gametic selection. As a consequence, we did not attempt to evaluate the opportunity for haploid selection in animals. Rather, we focused on plants, in which there is both a male (pollen) and female (ovule) haploid phase and during which many genes are expressed (e.g., as many as 60% of genes may be expressed in the male gametophyte [27,28]).\n\nIn order to evaluate the effect of the \u201copportunity for selection\u201d for male haploid phase on \u03c1, we used selfing rate as an indirect variable estimating the degree of pollen competition. We assume that with high selfing rates, there is less genetic variation among competing pollen grains and, therefore, less scope for haploid selection. We defined Vm (the degree of male gamete competition in plants) using three values depending on the amount of selfing: 0 for dioecious, self-incompatible or largely outcrossing (less than 5% selfing reported) species; 1 for species exhibiting low selfing rates (less than 30% reported); and 2 for other species. We used these three broad categories to reflect the fact that selfing rate is often variable within species and that it is often measured indirectly and with low precision. We therefore expect a positive effect of the variable Vm on \u03c1 if the opportunity for male gametic selection favours smaller \u03c1 values, as predicted by the modifier model [18]. We tested this effect using the 57 species for which we were able to estimate Vm (Table 3). We used a linear model in R [29] assuming that all species are either independent or phylogenetically related. In the latter case, we used a generalized estimating equations linear model [26] with a plant phylogenetic tree to the family level using data from Davies et al. [30], and several calibration points, including the Picea/Pinus divergence approximately 140 million years ago [31], that are not included in the Davies et al. dataset. We found an effect in the right direction with or without correcting for the phylogeny (linear effect of \u03c1 on Vm, p < 0.0002 in both cases, Figure 2). The fact that selfing plants exhibit higher recombination rates than their outcrossing relatives has been mentioned previously in the literature [32,33]. However, in most cases, recombination was measured only in male meiosis. It would be valuable to reexamine this trend in the light of our results that recombination in male meiosis is typically greater than in female meiosis among selfers.\n\nFigure 2 Logarithm of Male-Female Ratio in Recombination Rate in Plants\nMean and 95% confidence interval of \u03c1 is shown for different groups of plants, assuming normality and independent data points The number of species in each group is indicated next to the mean.\n\nTable 3 Plant Species Used to Test the Effect of Male and Female Opportunity for Selection\n\na\u2009Ratio refers to male-to-female recombination rate\n\nLM, linkage map; CC, chiasma count; n, haploid number of chromosomes; Vm, measure of male opportunity for haploid selection; Vf, measure of female opportunity for haploid selection\n\nIn order to evaluate the effect of the \u201copportunity for selection\u201d during the female haploid phase on \u03c1 in plants, we contrasted angiosperms with gymnosperms. In angiosperms, ovules do not compete much with each other on a mother plant, because resource accumulation starts after fertilisation (i.e., during fruit development in the diploid phase). In Pinus (three species in our dataset; see Table 2), male meiosis, female meiosis, and pollination occur in the year prior to fertilisation, but the pollen tube stops growing until the next spring, while the female gametophytes continue to accumulate resources and compete with each other over the course of the year. The same situation occurs in Picea, although the period between female meiosis and fertilisation is only 2\u20133 mo [34]. Perhaps more importantly, the endosperm (which is the organ managing resources for the zygote) is haploid in Pinaceae, in contrast to the double fertilisation that occurs in angiosperms to produce at least a diploid (typically triploid) endosperm [35,36]. We therefore expect that \u03c1 should be greater in Pinaceae, compared to angiosperms. We assigned Vf (the degree of female gamete competition in plants) the values 1 for gymnosperms and \u22121 for angiosperms. We expected a positive effect of the variable Vf on \u03c1 according to the modifier model. An effect in the right direction was indeed detected (linear effect of Vf on \u03c1, p = 0.011 and p = 0.0001, with and without correcting for the phylogeny as above, respectively; see Figure 2).\n\nWe thank G.

For example, in the Drosophila embryo, maternal morphogen gradients establish gap gene expression domain patterning along the anterior-posterior axis, through linkage with an elaborate gene network. To understand the evolution and behaviour of such systems better, it is important to establish the minimal determinants required for patterning. We have therefore engineered artificial transcription-translation networks that generate simple patterns, crudely analogous to the Drosophila gap gene system. The Drosophila syncytium was modelled using DNA-coated paramagnetic beads fixed by magnets in an artificial chamber, forming a gene expression network. Transient expression domain patterns were generated using various levels of network connectivity. Generally, adding more transcription repression interactions increased the \u201csharpness\u201d of the pattern while reducing overall expression levels. An accompanying computer model for our system allowed us to search for parameter sets compatible with patterning. While it is clear that the Drosophila embryo is far more complex than our simplified model, several features of interest emerge. For example, the model suggests that simple diffusion may be too rapid for Drosophila-scale patterning, implying that sublocalisation, or \u201ctrapping,\u201d is required. Second, we find that for pattern formation to occur under the conditions of our in vitro reaction-diffusion system, the activator molecules must propagate faster than the inhibitors. Third, adding controlled protease degradation to the system stabilizes pattern formation over time. We have reconstituted transcriptional pattern formation from purified substances, including phage RNA polymerases, ribonucleotides, and an eukaryotic translation extract. We anticipate that the system described here will be generally applicable to the study of any biological network with a spatial component.\n\nTo understand how patterns are established during early development, these authors have created an artificial system to mimic aspects of the early Drosophila embryo\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nEngineering a system to emulate a particular behaviour can be an extremely informative approach to systems biology [1,2,3,4,5]. Even if the natural biochemical interactions are well characterized, it remains a considerable challenge to reconstruct a physical system with the appropriate behaviour. Step-by-step reconstruction allows theoretical assumptions and models to be refined. Not only is complexity reduced by removing the context of the whole organism, but by reconstitution of pattern formation from purified substances (in this case, RNA polymerases, ribonucleotides, and a translation extract) the sufficiency of a proposed mechanism of pattern formation can be demonstrated.\n\nIn this work, our primary aim was the development of an in vitro system that allows the careful buildup of complex networks under controlled conditions. To demonstrate the usefulness of such a system, we decided to reconstruct a developmental pattern-formation program based on the formation of a gradient of a transcription activator\u2014a \u201cmorphogen\u201d\u2014and to link it to a network of transcription repressors. In a sense, we set out to design a patterning system similar to chemical reaction-diffusion systems (see below). However, the use of components such as transcription activators and repressors in an in vitro transcription-translation system made the system significantly closer to a biological system, albeit highly simplified when compared to the complexity of eukaryotic transcription [6].\n\nPatterning systems can be thought of as belonging to one of two principal types: First, there are systems with homogeneous initial conditions that self-organise after early random symmetry-breaking events ([7,8]; for a biological example, Fucus, see [9]). Second, there are systems with initial localisation of the components, which can form concentration gradients of activities from their respective sources [10,11].\n\nThe first class of patterning system, involving reaction-diffusion from initially homogeneous conditions, was first proposed by Turing in 1952 [7] and was further developed by Meinhardt and Gierer in the 1970s, in their model of patterning with short-range autoactivator and long-range lateral inhibitor [8]. Although there are many likely biological candidates for such activator-inhibitor systems (reviewed in [12]), none has been reengineered from first principles. In contrast, significant progress has been made in reconstituting purely chemical reactions that self-organise, such as the Belousov-Zhabotinski reactions [13,14,15] and Turing-type, Meinhardt-Gierer (M-G), and oscillatory reactions [16,17,18,19,20]. In a more biological context, similar spatiotemporal patterns, consisting of propagating concentration waves, have been modelled for a glycolytic enzyme oscillator in yeast [21].\n\nIn the second class of patterning system, where the initial conditions are nonhomogeneous, patterning begins with an asymmetry: a localised source of morphogen (shape-defining molecules that form a concentration gradient and function in a concentration-dependent manner so as to determine positional information in a patterning field [22]; reviewed in [23,24,25]).\n\nThe question of how morphogen gradients are formed and maintained is still a matter of keen debate and study [26,27,28], with many proposed mechanisms (reviewed in [29,30]). In the simplest case, a stable gradient could be formed by passive diffusion [31] and uniform degradation, although it has been suggested that enhanced morphogen degradation near the source leads to increased robustness against morphogen fluctuations during patterning [32]. Also, \u201cligand trapping\u201d by the receptor for a morphogen can have significant effects on the shape of a morphogen gradient [33], as in the case of Torso diffusing in the extracellular space surrounding the Drosophila oocyte [34].\n\nIn most cases in metazoa, morphogens define patterns over fields of many cells (reviewed in [30,35]), but there is one special case in embryonic development that has been particularly well studied, in which a morphogen gradient operates in a single-celled, multinuclear syncytium: the early Drosophila embryo [10,11]. In this system, early patterning is mediated by maternal morphogen factors, which are thought to diffuse and form gradients to guide patterning within a large multinuclear cell (reviewed in [36,37,38]). After egg deposition, an embryo forms a segmentation pattern within 3\u2009h, under the influence of a hierarchical sequence of gene expression interactions involving gap genes, pair-rule genes, and segment polarity genes [39]. Maternal elements\u2014in particular, the morphogen Bicoid\u2014guide this process, setting distinct initial conditions.\n\nWork by Driever and N\u00fcsslein-Volhard [10,11] demonstrated that Bicoid protein possessed three characteristics of a classic morphogen: (i) a localised source of cytoplasmic activity (through bicoid RNA transport to the anterior pole of the egg, involving microtubules and maternal genes [40,41,42,43,44]); (ii) formation of a concentration gradient from the source; and (iii) concentration-dependent activity that determines positional information within the gradient (reviewed in [38]). Bicoid has at least two functions that contribute to its function as a morphogen: transcription activation and translation inhibition. Acting as a transcription factor, Bicoid can activate a number of downstream gap genes, including hunchback, knirps, giant, and Kr\u00fcppel, whose products cross-react in a complex and mainly repressive interaction network to modulate each other's expression (reviewed in [37]; modelled in [45,46]). However, Bicoid does not simply function independently as a morphogen at the top of the gap gene hierarchy. Although Bicoid is responsible for anterior expression of zygotic Hunchback [47], it actually requires maternally expressed Hunchback as a cofactor to function anteriorly [48]. Meanwhile, in the posterior, the maternal hunchback mRNA is initially translationally repressed by the posterior determinant Nanos [49]. Moreover, the terminal gap genes tailless and huckebein are activated independently but serve to repress zygotic gap gene expression at the poles of the embryo, thus influencing patterning [50,51,52]. In its other role, as a translation inhibitor of caudal mRNA, Bicoid initially inhibits the uniformly expressed mRNA to form a concentration gradient of the protein Caudal [53,54]. Thus, the Caudal gradient [55] is essentially the inverse of the Bicoid gradient, and Caudal functions as a transcription activator in the posterior of the egg, further influencing expression of the gap gene network. Some of the important interactions in the gap gene network are shown in Figure 1A, although it should be noted that this overview is an oversimplification and does not consider differences in maternal and zygotic factor expression over time, nor does it consider all of the factors involved.\n\nFigure 1 Gene Circuits and Chambers\n(A) Principal interactions in the Drosophila gap gene network, modelled after [37].

Using an in vitro model, we wanted to address the following questions about patterning. First, how easy is it to generate an expression pattern in a gradient, using a diffusing activator from a localised source? Second, one of the outstanding issues in the field is to what extent correct positioning of the gap protein domain boundaries is specified by maternal morphogen gradients and by cross-repression between gap genes; a recent model suggests that repression is crucial for patterning and that threshold-dependent interpretation of the maternal morphogen concentration is not sufficient [56]. We therefore wanted to test the effect of transcription repression on pattern formation directly, by progressively adding more repression interactions in a designed gene network. Third, uniform degradation of a diffusing morphogen is often assumed to account for steady-state gradient formation, so we set out to test the effects of adding controlled degradation to an in vitro patterning system. Finally, we wanted to use our model to see how the scale and pattern of the system are affected by the relative rates of diffusion of individual components, and whether nonuniform diffusion of activators and inhibitors are required to form a pattern.\n\nResults\nDesign of the Network and Development of the In Vitro Experimental Platform\nWe began by designing a simplified gene network to emulate elements of the Drosophila gap gene system (Figure 1). The aim was to develop a fully synthetic approach in which protein analogues completely unrelated to Drosophila would emulate some of the transcription activation and repression interactions thought to be important for patterning in the gap gene system. As activators, two sequence-specific polymerases were employed, T7 and SP6, that have been used successfully by others to engineer gene networks [57]. These two polymerases bind to their respective consensus DNA recognition sites to initiate transcription, and thus represent an extremely simplified mode of transcription when compared to the multifactor complexes required for eukaryotic transcription (reviewed in [6]).\n\nT7 polymerase was chosen to be the \u201cmaster activator\u201d of the system and, by crude analogy, was expected to carry out some of the functions of Bicoid, namely transcription activation of downstream members in the gap gene hierarchy, in a concentration-dependent manner, from a localised source [10,11]. In Drosophila, the Bicoid morphogen gradient initially controls the shape of the Caudal protein gradient through translational repression of maternal mRNA [53,54], although later Caudal expression is under zygotic transcriptional control. To simplify this level of complexity, we decided to model Caudal transcription activation by a second gradient of T7 polymerase, from the opposite pole to our primary \u201cBicoid\u201d gradient (compare Figure 1A and 1C). Residual activation between other members of the gap gene members (e.g., Figure 1A, Hunchback activating Kr\u00fcppel or Kr\u00fcppel activating knirps) was modelled nonexplicitly by having a homogeneous distribution of a second sequence-specific transcription activator, SP6 polymerase (Figure 1A and 1C).\n\nRepression interactions between gap gene members were modelled by constructing three site-specific repressors to represent the repressor activities of Hunchback, Giant, and Kr\u00fcppel (Figure 1B, repressors A, B, and C, respectively). The repressors were derived from artificial zinc finger DNA-binding domains that were engineered by phage display [58]. Variable gene-repression networks were therefore constructed by placing binding sites for the repressors in the appropriate gene expression constructs (see for comparison Figure 2). Repressor sites were either overlapping with the polymerase initiation sites (demonstrated to be effective using triplex-forming oligonucleotides [59]), or immediately downstream of the initiation sites (Figure 2). Therefore, by changing the identity of the repressor sites, the connectivity of the network could readily be modified to add or remove cross-repressive interactions.\n\nFigure 2 Map of the Constructs Used in This Study\nThe repressor binding sites overlap with T7 or SP6 promoters and vary between constructs. In this way, it is possible to alter the connectivity of the repressive interactions by the products of genes A, B, and C. Repressive interactions are denoted by T-bars. The start codon of each gene is in Kozak context and is denoted by \u201cGCC ATG G.\u201d\n\nKey to the strategy was the development of an experimental platform in which to model the volume of the Drosophila embryo and to carry out artificial gene network reactions. Plastic chambers were therefore developed, constructed over printed templates on petri dishes (Figure 1D; see also Materials and Methods and Protocol S1). The chambers were filled with a customised transcription-translation mixture, allowing gene network reactions to be carried out in situ. Additionally, small bar magnets were fixed under the chamber to create a spatially defined array, over which paramagnetic beads could be dispensed. By coating such streptavidin-linked beads with biotinylated PCR products, specific gene network constructs were tethered and sublocalised on the array.\n\nFurthermore, ultra-low melting point agarose was added to the transcription-translation mixture, both to increase viscosity and to allow the reaction to be \u201cfixed\u201d in a gelling step at 4 \u00b0C. Through fixing, gel slices could be excised and assayed by Western blotting against FLAG-epitope tags on the expressed proteins. This design therefore enabled quantification of each output species present in the network (genes A, B, and C) for any given chamber position and time point.\n\nThe chambers were constructed such that the system components could be pipetted wherever desired, either homogeneously mixed with the transcription-translation mix or pipetted at defined loci, such as at the edges or \u201cpoles\u201d of the chamber. As described above, these system components included the two soluble, purified transcription activators (T7 and SP6 polymerases) and three bead-tethered zinc finger transcription-repressor constructs, A, B, and C, which were themselves activated by the polymerases and could cross-repress each other (see Figure 1).\n\nPositional information was therefore introduced into the artificial system in two ways. First, by injecting purified T7 polymerase at either pole of the chamber, the Bicoid activator distribution could be transiently modelled. Second, beads coated with different gene network constructs (genes A, B, and C), could be fixed at different positions on the magnetic array (see Figure 1D).\n\nFor example, repressor A genes were placed solely at the chamber edges (\u201cpoles\u201d) to model, loosely, the distribution of embryonic Hunchback activity. This part of the model is a significant oversimplification: Although Hunchback is eventually expressed in two domains, one anterior and one posterior [48], it is only expressed anteriorly in the early embryo. Furthermore, while maternal hunchback mRNA is evenly distributed, the anterior domain of Hunchback protein forms through zygotic translation and transcription activation (under the control of Bicoid), while maternal RNA is translationally repressed posteriorly, under the influence of Nanos [49,60,61]. In the later phase of hunchback regulation, the posterior Hunchback domain forms through a combination of factors, including activation by Tailless [62,63] and hunchback autoactivation [64].\n\nTo complete the model, the genes for repressors B and C were distributed uniformly throughout the chamber on magnetic beads, to represent the ubiquitous distribution of genes in nuclei, throughout the embryo. Therefore, the spatial expression of genes B and C, who represent the downstream gap gene members giant and Kr\u00fcppel (see Figure 1A and 1C), was dependent on differential activation by the T7 polymerase gradient and crossregulation between gene network members. However, it should be noted that the initial expression of these genes in Drosophila may not be achieved by crossregulation, because localised mRNA is seen before any protein is detectable (Kr\u00fcppel and Giant are only detected unambiguously in early cycle 13 [46]).\n\nPattern Generation In Vitro from a Transcription Network\nIn our first experiments, we constructed a simple, minimal network with sequential transcription activation and repression (see Figure 1B and 1C). Although this basic system is far less complex than the Drosophila gap gene system, it was indeed sufficient to generate a crude target behaviour (see Figure 1E and 1F). Qualitatively, the pattern can be explained as follows, Gene A is activated by T7 polymerase from its source at either end of the chamber, and so is expressed most highly at these poles. Gene B is similarly activated, and so it is also less expressed in the middle of the cell. However, since gene B is repressed by protein A, its levels are also reduced at either pole. Finally, Gene C is activated by a ubiquitous SP6 polymerase, but is repressed by proteins A and B, and is consequently centrally distributed.\n\nProgressing from the minimal network, we explored systems with a variety of connectivities (Figure 3), including a control network without repression interactions (Figure 3A), and one with extensive mutual or feedback interactions (Figure 3C). These were compared with the original network (Figure 3B) in a series of time-course experiments. Generally, we observed that the more repression interactions in a system, the lower the overall protein production but the \u201csharper\u201d the pattern.\n\nFigure 3 Alternative Gene Networks\nAt five set time points (15, 25, 35, 60, and 90 min), transcription-translation chambers were dissected into nine slabs for Western blot analysis.\n\n(A) Control network with no repression sites between genes A, B, and C.\n\n(B) Minimally repressed network (compare Figure 1).\n\n(C) Mutual repression network with extensive negative interactions between species. Adding protease (\u201c+ Degradation\u201d) creates weak but time-stable patterns for both the \u201cRepressed\u201d and \u201cMutual\u201d networks (35 versus 90 min). Quantitated graphs for the above data are available in Protocol S1.\n\nAll patterns degenerated to a significant degree by 60 min, indicating the transience of the system (Figure 3, 60 min). However, by adding Factor Xa protease, we were able approximately to match levels of production and degradation. Thus, the outputs became sharper, weaker, and more dynamically stable, hardly varying between 35 and 90 min (Figure 3B and 3C, \u201c+ Degradation\u201d).\n\nComputer Exploration of Parameter Space\nTo study parameter sensitivity in our system more comprehensively, we constructed a computer model of the chamber and networks (Protocol S1). A series of coupled differential equations were simulated, yielding expression levels of gene products A, B, and C, for the three different levels of network connectivity coded by our gene network designs (Figure 4). The modelling was carried out at two scales, that of our experimental system (18 mm long) and that of a Drosophila embryo (500 \u03bcm long). As in the experimental system (Figures 3 and 4A), the simulations revealed a large difference of pattern between the unrepressed and repressed systems. The patterns are more similar, however, between the simple and mutually repressed networks (Figure 4B) but, as in our in vitro experiments (e.g., see Figure 3B and 3C, 15 min), adding feedback repression makes the peaks better resolved.\n\nFigure 4 Comparison of Experimental Data and Computer Simulations\nData are shown for the three gene networks described in Figure 3, showing outputs for proteins A (cyan), B (magenta) and C (dark blue).\n\n(A) Quantitated Western blot data from Figure 3, after 25 min.\n\n(B) Simulation data plotted as percentage of total output protein against chamber length, at the chamber (18-mm) or Drosophila (0.5-mm) scale. The model is described in full in Protocol S1.\n\nNext, we explored the sensitivity of the simple repression network to diffusion parameters (Figure 5). Generally, we found that the A- and C-peaks were least sensitive to parameter variation, as there are no antagonistic forces against their formation (Figure 5A and 5C). By contrast, gene B is more sensitive: Twin-peak formation correlates with the relative diffusion ratios of activator (T7) and other mRNA/protein components (Figure 5B). To generate \u201ctarget behaviour,\u201d the activator must diffuse more rapidly than other species, within certain limits (approximately 5- to 50-fold faster for Figure 5B). However, the absolute values (and ratios) for diffusion merely alter the timing of the transient B-peak formation in a system of a given scale. For simplicity, only the 0.5-mm system is illustrated in Figure 5; similar conclusions were drawn from the 18-mm scale model.\n\nFigure 5 Varying Diffusion and Degradation Parameters\nComputer model of gene network, scaled to Drosophila length (0.5 mm). Diffusion parameters are varied for mRNA (Dm), protein (Dp), and T7 activator (DX). Data are plotted as percentage of total output protein (y-axes) against chamber position (x-axes), for 10-min simulations.\n\n(A) Outputs for protein A.\n\n(B) Output for protein B.

Drosophila may exploit such mechanisms to some extent, since Bicoid protein degrades in vivo (t1/2 \u2264 1800 s [11]), although bicoid mRNA is unusually stable [65].\n\nDiscussion\nTo develop a fully synthetic approach that will emulate elements of gap gene expression domain pattern formation, we created an in vitro transcription-translation system that allows flexible spatial gene network construction. The system is widely applicable, allowing control over factors such as localisation or diffusion, and the ability to add or remove components at will.\n\nRepressive Interactions and Pattern Formation\nA basic aim of our system was to see whether we could engineer a gradient of protein expression, using a diffusing activator from a localised source. We found this task straightforward in the transcription-translation chambers, using injected T7 polymerase, and this led us to try more complex expression-repression interactions. We constructed three types of gene network\u2014unrepressed, simple repressed, and mutually repressed (see Figure 3)\u2014representing different levels of network connectivity. Generally, in both our in vitro and computer models, we found that adding more connections resulted in better-resolved patterning, although the absolute levels of gene expression were reduced. Our in vitro results are essentially qualitative at this stage, but appear to agree with the observations of others\u2014that crossrepression is crucial for the control of patterning boundaries [56]. It will be interesting to learn whether more sophisticated elements can be engineered into the system to begin to emulate the more complex features of gap gene expression domain patterning. For example, dynamic anterior shifts are seen in domain expression over time because of asymmetric gap-gap crossrepression [56]. Asymmetric repression and other circuits could, in the future, be engineered into our chambers by altering the repressor binding sites in the appropriate constructs. Such a system would require component turnover to achieve steady-state patterning. We have begun to tackle this project through our experiments with controlled protease degradation, but a further requirement would be to have autocatalytic production of T7 polymerase from a localised source, rather than the injected pulse of purified polymerase in our current model.\n\nInterestingly, our experimental data showed a reproducible degree of patterning even in the unrepressed system (Figure 3A, 15 min, C output). Because gene C is activated by a separate polymerase (SP6), this patterning cannot result from competition for activator. Therefore, competition for other resources (such as ribosomes, nucleotides, and tRNAs) may allow A and B to \u201cinhibit\u201d C. Indeed, supplying extra components (particularly wheat germ extract and SP6 polymerase together) increases protein production under these conditions, including that of C (unpublished data). If competition can generate patterns, albeit less well defined ones than repression-connected networks, this could perhaps represent an evolutionary \u201cnetwork precursor\u201d state: Weak patterns could be generated by localisation and competition between factors, and these could later be consolidated by evolution of a \u201ctrue\u201d negative network connection. However, this hypothesis may not be relevant to the situation inside an insect egg, as this has probably evolved to deliver nutrients very efficiently to the embryo, even at a very primitive evolutionary stage. It therefore remains to be seen whether competition effects would be as significant in vivo.\n\nSince our models use minimal components to achieve spatial pattern formation, they demonstrate the ease with which very simple networks might evolve. Patterning may be achieved with only localisation, diffusion, and some kind of functional network connection, such as transcription activation, competition, or repression. The addition of extra layers of network properties, such as controlled degradation, could then fix and stabilize such patterns. In fact, since sublocalisation\u2014followed by stepwise addition of network components\u2014is sufficient to generate crude patterns, it might provide a plausible mechanism for early spatial network evolution inside a single cell. However, it should be noted that gap gene expression domain patterning probably evolved by a different mechanism, from an earlier multicellular state, where segments were added sequentially through polar growth. In fact, bicoid is absent in most other insects, and it has been proposed that Drosophila evolved bicoid by duplication of the homeodomain-encoding gene zerkn\u00fcllt, found in lower Diptera [66].\n\nDiffusion Rates and Patterning\nWe were intrigued by our observations, both in vitro and in silico, that patterning required the activator molecule to diffuse or propagate more rapidly than the inhibitors. This is interesting because it is the opposite of the M-G system (described in the Introduction and reviewed in [12]). Long-range activation is not unknown in chemical patterning systems [67], although many biological models appear to require the M-G criterion for long-range inhibition (e.g., [68]). The other obvious differences between our system and the M-G model are the initial localisation of components and the lack of autocatalysis of the activator. It will be interesting to determine whether such M-G patterning systems can be recreated in our chambers, once further factors are considered, such as the avoidance of \u201cautocatalytic explosions\u201d or \u201cglobal inhibitions.\u201d\n\nThe computer model that we developed allowed us to test a broad range of parameters, such as diffusion and degradation rates (Figure 5), revealing differences between the requirements for patterning among the different species in the gene network. First, the more-connected member of the network (gene B) was much more sensitive to parameter variation than the less-connected members (genes A and C). This is perhaps to be expected, since protein B has two separate boundaries of expression (defined as a function of T7 distribution and both A and C expression), whereas proteins A and C have only single \u201cedges\u201d to be defined.\n\nAnother important feature of the system emerged when scaling the parameters for the model patterns to Drosophila scale (Figure 5, 0.5 mm \u201cembryo,\u201d 2.5 h). We found that, assuming simple diffusion, B-peak formation was compatible only with unphysiologically slow diffusion values (diffusion constants for mRNA [Dm] and protein [Dp] = 0.02 \u03bcm2s\u22121; for T7 activator [DX] = 0.43 \u03bcm2s\u22121). Since cellular proteins are expected to diffuse more rapidly (approximately 1\u2013100 \u03bcm2s\u22121), this could be an artefact, reflecting the simplicity of our model. Nonetheless, simple diffusion still appears too rapid to account for Drosophila-scale patterning. It should be noted that a potential barrier to free diffusion is the active nuclear import of Bicoid and Hunchback [69]. In a separate example, diffusion of pair-rule transcripts is overridden by microtubule transport [70]. Controlled sublocalisation may therefore be crucial to limit apparent diffusion in vivo, allowing more precise patterning.\n\nPerspectives\nThe understanding of how precision of patterning is achieved in Drosophila is still far from complete. In a recent study, it was shown that the Bicoid profile is far more variable between embryos than that of Hunchback, but the mechanism by which this noise is filtered remains unknown [71]. As more and more detailed experimental data are collected [72], and new mechanisms are proposed to account for patterning, it will be important to test the sufficiency of these mechanisms through experimental reconstitution. For such purposes, the chambers described here may be easily adapted to test different hypotheses. In vitro systems are a useful first step towards testing the sufficiency of a network\u2014which might then be reengineered in the original target organism.\n\nCombining simple reconstruction with theoretical modelling is a useful tool to discover and test general design principles in gene networks [73,74,75,76]. Until now, however, the spatial component essential in many biological processes has been ignored in these approaches. We anticipate that other networks, such as signalling cascades or metabolic networks, might also be studied using our system and that the spatial element, introduced through the beads, might provide new insights into complex systems.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nMagnetic chamber construction\nA detailed, step-by-step description of the construction of the chamber can be found in Protocol S1. Briefly, nine stirring-bar magnets (1.5 mm \u00d7 8 mm; VWR International, Vienna, Austria; #4429025) were inserted vertically into a plasticine-filled standard petri dish, creating a magnetic array (see Figure 1D). Construction was guided with a grid template, laser-printed on a transparent acetate sheet, and fixed over the magnets and plasticine. The template was a 3 mm \u00d7 18 rectangle with nine subdivisions (\u201cslabs\u201d). A sterile cell culture dish (Nalge Nunc, Rochester, New York, United States; #150350) was fixed immediately above the magnetic array. Chamber borders (1 mm deep) were constructed on the base of this second dish, following the template, using strips cut from adhesive Hybriwell chambers (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, United States; #H1159\u2013100EA).\n\nGene network constructs\nMaps of the constructs are illustrated in Figure 2. Repressors A, B, and C were derived from previously engineered zinc fingers [58]. Repressor A contained six zinc fingers, recognising the sequence 5\u2032-\nAGGGAGGCGGACTGGGGA-3\u2032, fused to the residues 11\u201355 of the Kox-1 repression domain [77] and a six-repeat FLAG epitope tag [78]. Repressor B contained six zinc fingers, recognising the sequence 5\u2032-\nAGGGAGGCGGGAGCTTTC-3\u2032 and fused to a three-repeat FLAG-tag. Repressor C contained three zinc fingers, recognising the sequence 5\u2032-\nGGAGCTTTC-3\u2032, fused to the Kox domain and a three-repeat FLAG-tag. The following polymerase consensus promoter regions were used: T7, 5\u2032-\nTAATACGACTCACTATAG\nGGAG-3\u2032; SP6, 5\u2032-\nATTTAGGTGACACTATAG\nAAGGG-3\u2032. The gene network promoters were linked with neutral or repressor sites to the polymerase promoters.\n\n\nIn the following nucleotide sequences, zinc finger binding sites are indicated in lowercase, initiation nucleotides in bold, and promoter overlaps underlined.

Constructs were cloned in pCaSpeR4, sequenced, and used to generate PCR DNA for in vitro transcription-translation.\n\n\nGene network reactions\nParamagnetic beads were coated with PCR DNA (with one primer biotinylated) using a Dynabeads Kilobase Binder Kit (Dynal, Oslo, Norway; #601.01). Typically, gene A was used at 800 fmol per 10 \u03bcl of beads, resuspended in 8 \u03bcl of water; 200 fmol of gene B and 140 fmol of gene C were combined with 20 \u03bcl of beads, and resuspended in 20 \u03bcl of water.\n\nTranscription-translation mixture was prepared that included 2.5 \u03bcl of water; 28 \u03bcl of ultra-low melting point agarose (Sigma; #A2576) solution (prepared as 1.5% [w/v] in boiling water and cooled to 30 \u00b0C); and TNT Coupled Wheat Germ Extract System (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States; #L4130 and #L4140), which comprised 20 \u03bcl of TNT wheat germ extract, 1.2 \u03bcl of TNT reaction buffer, 0.6 \u03bcl of amino acid mixture (1 mM), 1.2 \u03bcl of RNasin (not included in TNT kit), and 0.5 \u03bcl of SP6 polymerase. 54 \u03bcl of this mixture was dispensed per chamber.\n\nFor degradation experiments, 2.25 units of Factor Xa (Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom) were added per chamber. Coated Dynabeads were injected at appropriate positions over the magnetic array: typically, 100 fmol of gene A (1 \u03bcl), 5 fmol of gene B, and 3.5 fmol of gene C (0.5 \u03bcl). T7 polymerase (0.5 \u03bcl; from Promega TNT kit) was immediately injected at the chamber edges. After timed incubations at 25 \u00b0C, chambers were transferred to 4 \u00b0C for 35 min, to form a gel. Gel slices were cut with a razor blade (guided by the printed template) and aspirated with a P10 Gilson pipette. Samples were mixed with 10 \u03bcl of SDS-loading buffer and analysed by SDS-PAGE, Western blotting, and ECL, with anti-M2 FLAG antibody (Sigma; #F3165). Further details on this step can be found in Protocol S1.\n\nComputer modelling\nA Perl script was written to simulate the diffusion-coupled expression of genes A, B, and C, by T7 and SP6 phage polymerases, in a translation extract. The program parameters and script are fully described in Protocols S1\u2013S3. 18 mm-scale chamber model: Parameters included separate diffusion (and degradation) rates for RNA and protein; a separate apparent diffusion for injected T7, modelled from experimental observations (rapid initial diffusion with exponential decay; Section 5 of Protocol S1); estimated binding constants for all interacting species (zinc finger dissociation constants were estimated from previous work on related three- and six-finger constructs [58,79,80]); and estimated transcription-translation rates. For adapting the model to the 0.5-mm Drosophila scale, chamber size was scaled down, and only simple diffusion was allowed for all components; for simplicity, transcription-translation rates were not varied (Section 3 of Protocol S1).\n\n\nSupporting Information\nProtocol S1 Detailed Description of Model\n(1.2 MB PDF).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Protocol S2 Parameter File for Simulations\nThis file contains the default parameters for the computer model in a format that can be read by the Perl script.\n\n(5 KB DOC).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Protocol S3 Computer Program Script for Simulations\nThis text file is a Perl script to run the computer simulations described in the manuscript.\n\n(22 KB DOC).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Accession Numbers\nThe Locuslink (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/LocusLink/, or GeneID (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/query.fcgi?db=gene, accession numbers of the genes and proteins discussed in this paper are Bicoid (40830), caudal (35341), giant (31227), huckebein (40549), hunchback (41032), knirps (40287), Kr\u00fcppel (38012), Nanos (42297), tailless (43656), Torso (35717), and zerkn\u00fcllt (40828).\n\nWe would like to thank K.

Patterns of genetic variation in hunter\u2013gatherer groups such as the !Kung and African Pygmies are consistent with this view, as they exhibit low genetic diversity coupled with high frequencies of divergent mtDNA types not found in surrounding agricultural groups, suggesting long-term isolation and small population sizes. We report here genetic evidence concerning the origins of the Mlabri, an enigmatic hunter\u2013gatherer group from northern Thailand. The Mlabri have no mtDNA diversity, and the genetic diversity at Y-chromosome and autosomal loci are also extraordinarily reduced in the Mlabri. Genetic, linguistic, and cultural data all suggest that the Mlabri were recently founded, 500\u2013800 y ago, from a very small number of individuals. Moreover, the Mlabri appear to have originated from an agricultural group and then adopted a hunting\u2013gathering subsistence mode. This example of cultural reversion from agriculture to a hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle indicates that contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups do not necessarily reflect a pre-agricultural lifestyle.\n\nGenes, language and culture reveal that the Mlabri reverted from an agricultural to a hunter-gatherer lifestyle, suggesting that hunter-gatherer groups might not always represent the pre- agricultural lifestyle of humans\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nThe Mlabri are an enigmatic group of about 300 people who nowadays range across the Nan, Phrae, and Phayao provinces of north and northeastern Thailand and the Sayaburi province of western Laos [1,2]. Their traditional lifestyle is to move frequently through the dense forests of the high mountains, building temporary structures of bamboo sticks thatched with banana leaves, which they occupy for a few days, until the leaves turn yellow (thus accounting for their traditional Thai name, Phi Tong Luang, which means \u201cspirit of the yellow leaves\u201d). First contacted by Europeans in 1936 [3], they are unique among the hill tribes of northern Thailand in that, until recently, they subsisted by hunting and gathering combined with occasional barter trade with villagers.\n\nThe origins of the Mlabri are controversial. Some investigators have assumed that there is a direct connection between the Mlabri and the ancient Hoabinhian hunting\u2013gathering culture of Southeast Asia [1]. However, a limited investigation of blood group variation [4] raised the possibility that the Mlabri originated via a founder event from an agricultural group, and preliminary linguistic analyses support this idea. The Mlabri language seems lexically most closely related to Khmu and Tin, two languages of the Khmuic branch of the Mon-Khmer sub-family of Austro-Asiatic languages, both of which are spoken in agricultural highland villages [5]. The cluster of dialects jointly referred to as Tin, or Mal/Prai, [6] is spoken in the Thailand\u2013Laos border region that the Mlabri also occupy, whereas Khmu is spoken over a much wider area [7]. The grammar of Mlabri additionally has features that deviate markedly from typical Mon-Khmer, suggesting that Mlabri developed as a result of contact between speakers of a Khmuic language and speakers of a quite different language of unknown affiliation [2,8].\n\nWe report here the results of an investigation of genetic diversity in the Mlabri, to see whether patterns of genetic variation might provide further insights into the question of an agricultural versus hunting\u2013gathering origin for the Mlabri. The rationale for using genetic analyses to investigate this question is that previous work has shown that hunter\u2013gatherer groups typically differ from their agricultural neighbors in having reduced genetic diversity and high frequencies of unique mtDNA types [9,10,11,12,13,14], so we might expect a similar pattern if the Mlabri have always been hunter\u2013gatherers. The genetic results, combined with linguistic and cultural evidence, suggest that the most probable explanation for the origin of the Mlabri is an extreme founder event from an agricultural group, followed by adoption of a hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle.\n\nResults/Discussion\nGenetic Analyses: mtDNA Diversity\nWe analyzed 360 bp of the first hypervariable segment (HV1) of the mtDNA control region in 58 Mlabri; surprisingly, all of the sequences were identical, with the following differences from the reference sequence [15]: 16140C, 16189C, and 16266A, as well as the common Asian 9-bp deletion in the intergenic region between the cytochrome oxidase subunit II and lysine tRNA genes [16]. No other human population has been found to lack mtDNA HV1 variation, and mtDNA HV1 variation in six other hill tribes (all agricultural groups) from the same region of Thailand was significantly higher (Figure 1; Table 1).\n\nFigure 1 Genetic Diversity in the Mlabri and Other Hill Tribes\nGenetic diversity based on mtDNA HV1 sequences, Y-STR haplotypes, and autosomal STR (A-STR) genotypes in the Mlabri, compared to the average genetic diversity for six other hill tribes. The haplotype diversity is indicated for the mtDNA and Y-STR data, while the average heterozygosity is indicated for the autosomal STR loci.\n\nTable 1 Genetic Diversity Parameters Based on mtDNA HV1 Sequences, Y-STR Haplotypes, and Autosomal STR Genotypes for the Mlabri and the Six Other Hill Tribes\nDiversity in the Mlabri is significantly lower than the average for the other groups for all three genetic systems, based on t-tests (not shown)\n\n\na\u2009Probability of the observed heterozygosity excess under the stepwise mutation model, Wilcoxon one-tailed test\n\nY-Chromosome Diversity\nWe analyzed nine short tandem repeat (STR) loci on the Y chromosome in 54 Mlabri, and again found significantly reduced variation in the Mlabri compared to the other six hill tribes (Figure 1; Table 1). The Mlabri had just four Y-chromosome STR (Y-STR) haplotypes, two of which differed by a single repeat at a single locus from one each of the other two haplotypes (Table 2). The Y-STR haplotype diversity in the Mlabri is again lower than that reported for any other human population [17,18]; the Akha, one of the six other hill tribes, also exhibited very low Y-STR diversity (Table 1). The average variance in the allele size distribution at the nine Y-STR loci shows an even greater contrast between the Mlabri and the other hill tribes: the average variance was 0.11 for the Mlabri, versus an average of 1.45 for the other six hill tribes.\n\nTable 2 Y-STR Haplotypes in the Mlabri\nThe number of repeats for the allele at each locus in the four haplotypes is given\n\nAutosomal DNA Diversity\nWe analyzed nine autosomal STR loci in the Mlabri and the other six hill tribes, and again found significantly reduced variation in the Mlabri (Figure 1; Table 1). The genotype frequencies did not deviate significantly from Hardy\u2013Weinberg expectations for any locus in the Mlabri; however, even though these nine STR loci are on different chromosomes and hence unlinked, eight pairs of loci exhibited significant linkage disequilibrium (LD) (p < 0.05; Figure 2), as measured by a likelihood ratio test [19]. This is significantly more (p < 0.01) than the 1.8 pairs expected by chance (out of 36 pairwise comparisons) to exhibit this level of LD. For each of the six agricultural hill tribes, the number of pairs of loci exhibiting significant LD was within expectations (Figure 2). Moreover, the p-value of the likelihood ratio test is a measure of the strength of the association between two loci [19]; the average p-value was 0.20 for the Mlabri, versus 0.31\u20130.55 for the other six hill tribes, indicating that overall associations between these unlinked loci were stronger in the Mlabri than in the other hill tribes. However, the sample size for the Mlabri for the autosomal STR analyses was larger than the sample size for the other hill tribes (n = 35 for the Mlabri, versus n = 29\u201330 for the others), so it is possible that the lower average p-value for the Mlabri reflects more statistical power due to a larger sample size and not more LD. To test this, we sampled 30 Mlabri at random and redid the LD analysis; the conclusions did not change, indicating that the lower average p-value for the Mlabri does reflect more LD in the Mlabri.\n\nFigure 2 Associations amongst Unlinked Autosomal STR Loci in the Mlabri and the Other Hill Tribes\nProbability values of the likelihood ratio test of association versus no association for nine unlinked autosomal STR loci in the Mlabri and six other hill tribes (average probability over the 36 pairs of loci in parentheses).\n\nOne explanation for the reduced diversity at mtDNA, Y-STR loci, and autosomal STR loci, and the significant number of pairs of unlinked autosomal STR loci in LD, is a severe reduction in population size in the Mlabri. Following such an event, the number of alleles is reduced more than the heterozygosity, leading to an excess of observed heterozygosity compared to that expected for the observed number of alleles under mutation\u2013drift equilibrium [20]. We therefore compared the observed and expected heterozygosity (at mutation\u2013drift equilibrium, conditioned on the observed number of alleles) for the autosomal STR loci in the Mlabri and the six other hill tribes, under a stepwise mutation model. Only the Mlabri exhibited a significant excess of observed heterozygosity (Table 1). Although more complicated scenarios are possible, the simplest explanation is that the Mlabri (but not the other hill tribes) have undergone a severe reduction in population size, as also indicated by the mtDNA and Y-STR haplotype data, and as also suggested by a previous study of blood group variation [4].\n\nPopulation Size Reduction in the Mlabri\nAssuming that there was a reduction in population size in the Mlabri that set the mtDNA and Y-chromosome diversity near or equal to zero, the coalescence times for the Mlabri mtDNA and Y-STR haplotypes provide an upper estimate as to when the population reduction occurred. We therefore applied Bayesian-based coalescence analysis [21] to the mtDNA sequences and the Y-STR haplotypes from the Mlabri and the other six hill tribes. For the six agricultural hill tribes, the resulting estimates of coalescence time are broadly distributed (Figure 3), indicating little information in the data (except for the Akha, who do show a pronounced peak in the posterior probability distribution for the Y-STR data, in accordance with their lower Y-STR haplotype diversity). By contrast, the estimates of coalescence time for the Mlabri show a sharp peak (Figure 3), with a median time of 770 y (approximate 95% credible interval 250\u20134,270 y) for the mtDNA sequences and 490 y (approximate 95% credible interval 170\u20131,290 y) for the Y-STR haplotypes.\n\nFigure 3 Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor for mtDNA and Y-STR Types for the Mlabri and the Other Hill Tribes\nPosterior probability distribution of the time back to the most recent common ancestor for the mtDNA (A) and Y-STR haplotype (B) data for the Mlabri and six other hill tribes.\n\nBoth the mtDNA and the Y-STR data therefore indicate that the Mlabri underwent a substantial reduction in population size about 500\u2013800 y ago (and not more than about 1,300 y ago, if the mtDNA and Y-chromosome data reflect the same event). There are two possible scenarios: (1) a bottleneck, in which the Mlabri were reduced from a formerly large population to a much smaller population size, which then increased to the current level of about 300 individuals; or (2) a founder event, in which the Mlabri began as a very small number of individuals, became isolated, and then increased over time to their present size. Similar reductions in genetic diversity are predicted under either scenario, so the genetic data cannot distinguish between these. But some information can be obtained by considering the magnitude of the reduction in population size needed to completely eliminate mtDNA diversity in the Mlabri.\n\nThe amount of population size reduction needed to completely eliminate mtDNA diversity in the Mlabri depends on how much mtDNA diversity was present prior to the size reduction. We assumed that the ancestral Mlabri population would have the same mtDNA diversity as one of the other hill tribes and then estimated the amount of population size reduction needed to completely eliminate mtDNA diversity by resampling with replacement various numbers of mtDNA types from the ancestral (pre-bottleneck) population. For example, we started with an ancestral population with the same distribution of mtDNA types as the Akha. We then sampled two mtDNA types (with replacement) from this ancestral population, repeated this procedure 1,000 times, and found that 243 out of the 1,000 resamples of size two had no mtDNA diversity; thus, the probability is 0.243 that a reduction to just two individuals would eliminate mtDNA diversity in an ancestral population that started with the same mtDNA diversity as the Akha. We then repeated this procedure, sampling three mtDNA types (with replacement), and obtained a probability of 0.007 that there would be no mtDNA diversity following a reduction to three individuals. Therefore, if the Mlabri were derived from a population with the same mtDNA diversity as the Akha, the population had to be reduced to not more than two unrelated females, in order to completely eliminate mtDNA diversity.\n\nThis resampling analysis was carried out six times, with the putative ancestral mtDNA diversity corresponding to each of the six hill tribes. The results of this analysis were that for five of the ancestral populations, resampling three (or more) individuals gave a probability of no mtDNA diversity of less than 0.05; for the remaining ancestral population (which had the same starting mtDNA diversity as the Red Karen), resampling four (or more) individuals gave a probability of no mtDNA diversity of less than 0.05.\n\nWe also carried out a similar analysis for the Y-STR types in the Mlabri. Here we again assumed an ancestral population with the same Y-STR haplotype diversity as one of the other hill tribes, then determined the maximum number of individuals that could be sampled at random that would have not more than two Y-STR types (since the four Y-STR types in the Mlabri consist of two pairs that differ by a single-step mutation at a single locus). The results of this analysis were that at most 3\u20136 individuals (depending on which hill tribe the ancestral population resembled most in terms of Y-STR diversity) could have been present after the size reduction, otherwise, with greater than 95% probability, more than two Y-STR types would have been retained.\n\nA critical assumption is the amount of genetic diversity present in the ancestral Mlabri population prior to the size reduction. The estimates used in the above analysis are based on agricultural populations, which in general have more mtDNA diversity than hunter\u2013gatherer populations. We therefore also constructed putative ancestral populations with frequency distributions of mtDNA types identical to those found in the !Kung and in African Pygmies [22]; the results of the resampling analysis were the same.\n\nAnother assumption of this analysis is that the event that led to the population size reduction completely eliminated the mtDNA diversity. Alternatively, some mtDNA diversity may have been present after the population size reduction, but was subsequently lost because of drift. Loss of mtDNA diversity due to subsequent drift is not likely if there was a single event reducing the Mlabri population size that was followed by population growth, since mtDNA diversity is retained in growing populations [23]. However, if the reduction in size occurred over several generations, then it may not have been as dramatic a bottleneck as the resampling analysis implies.\n\nTo investigate this further, we employed a Bayesian approach, following the procedure previously used to estimate the number of founders for the Maoris [24] but allowing for new mutations, to estimate the number of founders for the Mlabri, assuming various time periods since the founding event. The results (Figure 4) indicate that the most probable number of founders is one over all time periods; however, for longer time periods since the founding event, there is decreasing information on the number of founders from the observation of no mtDNA diversity in the Mlabri. As expected, the longer the time since the founding event (i.e., the slower the population growth rate), the greater the influence of drift in eliminating diversity that might have been present in the founding population. Nevertheless, given that the coalescent analyses indicate an upper date for the origin of the Mlabri of about 1,000 y ago, the lack of mtDNA diversity in the Mlabri is most consistent with a very small founding population size, perhaps even only one female lineage.\n\nFigure 4 Number of Founding Individuals in the Mlabri, Given No mtDNA Diversity\nPosterior probability distribution for the number of founding individuals (k), conditioned on the observation of no diversity in a sample of 58 mtDNA sequences and the time since the founding event. The prior probability is indicated by the dashed black line.\n\nOrigin of the Mlabri\nThe group that gave rise to the founder event that established the Mlabri could have been either a hunter\u2013gatherer group, in which case the Mlabri maintained their hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle from before, or an agricultural group, in which case the Mlabri subsequently adopted their current hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle. While the genetic data cannot unequivocally distinguish between these two possibilities, they do suggest the latter. Other hunter\u2013gatherer groups typically share few, if any, mtDNA types with neighboring agricultural groups, consistent with long-term isolation of the hunter\u2013gatherer groups. For example, !Kung, African Pygmies, Andamanese Islanders, and south Indian hunter\u2013gatherer groups can readily be distinguished from nearby agricultural groups on the basis of their mtDNA sequences [9,13,14,25]. By contrast, the Mlabri mtDNA sequence has been reported in other, agricultural hill tribes [26,27], and identical or closely related sequences have also been reported from Southeast Asia and China [9,28,29]. Similarly, the Mlabri Y-STR haplotypes are identical or closely related (differing by a single-step mutation at one locus) to Y-STR haplotypes found in Southeast Asia and Oceania [30,31]. Also, the Mlabri do not exhibit any alleles at the nine autosomal STR loci that are not found in the agricultural hill tribes.\n\nThe widespread sharing of mtDNA, Y-STR, and autosomal STR alleles between the Mlabri and agricultural groups in Southeast Asia are not expected if the Mlabri have always been hunter\u2013gatherers. Instead, the genetic data suggest that the Mlabri are derived from an agricultural group. Moreover, the Mlabri vocabulary and folklore also give some evidence of ancient familiarity with agriculture coexisting with hunting and gathering (J. Rischel, personal communication). While preliminary in nature, the available linguistic evidence suggests that the present-day Mlabri language arose after some speakers of a Khmuic language, most likely Tin, became isolated and subsequently experienced intensive contact with speakers of some other, presently unknown language [2,8]. Just how long ago the Mlabri and Tin languages diverged cannot be determined, but it has been suggested that Tin branched from Khmu about 600 y ago, and that Tin then branched into two varieties (Mal and Prai) some 200\u2013300 y ago [6,32]. These time estimates are based on a calibration of the chronology of sound changes in Tin against reasonably secure datings of sound changes in neighboring languages; the actual time depth may be underestimated, but most likely by not more than a few centuries. Thus, the linguistic evidence would date the origin of the Mlabri at less than 1,000 y ago, in excellent agreement with the genetic evidence.\n\nOther data that may shed light on the origins of the Mlabri, such as historical information, are scarce, since the Mlabri do not have a written language and the first recorded contact was only in 1936. However, the Tin Prai have an oral tradition concerning the origin of the Mlabri (J. Rischel, personal communication), in which several hundred years ago, Tin Prai villagers expelled two children and sent them downriver on a raft. They survived and escaped into the forest, turning to a foraging lifestyle and thus becoming the Mlabri. Although it is difficult to know how to evaluate such oral traditions, this story nevertheless intriguingly parallels the genetic and linguistic evidence concerning the origins of the Mlabri.\n\nIn sum, genetic, linguistic, and cultural data all suggest a founding event in the Mlabri, involving a single maternal lineage and 1\u20134 paternal lineages some 500\u20131,000 y ago, from an ancestral agricultural population. The Mlabri then subsequently adopted their present hunting and gathering lifestyle, possibly because the group size at the time of founding was too small to support an agricultural lifestyle. Other examples of such cultural reversion are rare; probably the best known involves Polynesian hunter\u2013gatherers on the Chatham Islands and the South Island of New Zealand [33], who abandoned agriculture and adopted a maritime-based foraging subsistence because of the rich marine resources and the inability of these islands to support cultivation of tropical crops. Other hypothesized examples of cultural reversion, such as the Punan of Borneo [34], the Guaj\u00e1 and other lowland Amazonian groups [35], and the Sirion\u00f3 of Bolivia [36], are controversial, as it is not clear whether these groups are descended directly from earlier hunter\u2013gatherer groups or whether they indeed have undergone cultural reversion. Detailed genetic analyses, as carried out here for the Mlabri, may shed further light in these cases.\n\nIn any event, our conclusion that the Mlabri, a present-day group of hunters and gatherers, was founded recently and in all probability from an agricultural group further supports the contention that contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups cannot be automatically assumed to represent the pre-agricultural lifestyle of human populations, descended unchanged from the Stone Age [37]. Indeed, even if they have not reverted from an agricultural lifestyle, most (if not all) contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups interact with, and have evolved and changed along with, agricultural groups [38]. The Mlabri provide a unique opportunity to investigate the circumstances and consequences of a reversion from an agricultural to a hunting\u2013gathering lifestyle that apparently was not dictated by purely ecological reasons (as in the case of Polynesian hunter\u2013gatherers).\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nSamples\nThere are three linguistically distinct subgroups of Mlabri [39], designated A, B, and C. Subgroup A (also known erroneously as \u201cMrabri\u201d) is the only group that has been studied in detail [1]; subgroup B (minor Mlabri) is practically extinct [2], and subgroup C (formerly \u201cYumbri\u201d) comprises less than 30 people [39]. Blood samples and genealogies of 91 Mlabri (all from subgroup A) were obtained with informed consent in 1999, and cell lines were prepared and DNA was extracted from the cell lines. The genealogical data were used to identify and exclude known relatives from the genetic analyses. Data on mtDNA and Y-STR variation from six agricultural hill tribes in the same geographic region (Akha, Lahu, White Karen, Red Karen, CR Lisu [from near Chiang Rai], and MHS Lisu [from near Mae Hong Son]), all of whom speak Sino-Tibetan languages, were published previously [26].\n\nGenetic analyses\nThe first hypervariable segment (HV1) of the mtDNA control region (nucleotide positions 16,024\u201316,385) was amplified and sequenced directly, as described previously [29], from 58 Mlabri. PCR analysis of the intergenic region between the cytochrome oxidase subunit II and lysine tRNA genes, which harbors an informative 9-bp deletion, was carried out as described previously [28]. Nine Y-STR loci (DYS385a, DYS385b, DYS389I, DYS389II, DYS390, DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, and DYS394) were amplified and genotypes determined, using previously described methods [30], for 54 Mlabri. Nine autosomal STR loci (D3S1358, vWA, FGA, D8S1179, D21S11, D18S51, D5S818, D13S317, and D7S820) plus the amelogenin locus were amplified with the AmpFLSTR Profiler Plus PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California, United States), using 2\u20134 ng of DNA in a 15-\u03bcl reaction volume. Genotypes were determined by fragment analysis on an ABI377 (Applied Biosystems) for 35 Mlabri, 29 Lahu, and 30 individuals from each of the other hill tribes.\n\nStatistical analyses\nGenetic diversity, heterozygosity, and tests for goodness of fit to Hardy\u2013Weinberg expectations were calculated with Arlequin 2.000 [40]. LD was estimated as the probability of the likelihood of the data assuming linkage equilibrium versus the likelihood of the data assuming association [19]; Arlequin 2.000 was used to obtain maximum-likelihood estimates of the haplotype frequencies for each pair of loci with the EM algorithm [41], and the null distribution of the p-value of the likelihood ratio test was generated by 10,000 random permutations. The program Bottleneck (http://www.ensam.inra.fr/URLB/bottleneck/bottleneck.html) was used to compare the observed heterozygosity at each autosomal STR locus to that expected at mutation\u2013drift equilibrium for the observed number of alleles, assuming a stepwise mutation model. Bayesian-based coalescence analyses of Y-STR haplotypes [42] were performed using the software Batwing (http://www.maths.abdn.ac.uk/~ijw/downloads/batwing/batguide/node6.html) and previously described prior distributions for the initial effective population size, population growth rate, and Y-STR mutation rates [30]. The coalescence time for mtDNA HV1 sequences was also estimated by a Bayesian procedure [21] as described previously for Xq13.3 sequences [43], using the same initial effective population size and population growth rate priors as for the Y-STR analysis, and a \u03b3-distribution with parameters \u03b1 = 14.74 and \u03b2 = 0.0005 (corresponding mean = 0.00737) as a prior for the mutation rate [44]. Resampling of mtDNA and Y-STR types, in order to estimate the magnitude of population size reduction needed to eliminate mtDNA and reduce Y-STR diversity, was performed with the software Resample (http://www.pbs.port.ac.uk/~woodm/resample.htm). Bayesian analysis of the number of founders for the Mlabri was performed by pooling the mtDNA types in the other hill tribes to obtain a starting population, from which a certain number of founding mtDNA types were selected at random, assuming a uniform prior distribution between one and 20 founders. The sample was then allowed to grow from the number of founders to size 300 (the current size of the Mlabri population) over various time intervals, such that the shorter the time interval, the faster the growth rate. Simulations were performed both under the assumption of no new mutations, and with a mutation rate of one mutation/sequence/10,000 y. For each combination of parameters, 1,000,000 simulations were carried out. The simulation results were converted via Bayes's theorem into a posterior probability for the number of founding individuals, conditioned on the observation of no diversity in a random sample of size 58 (the sample size in this study). In practice, the posterior probability distributions were independent of the mutation rate (analyses not shown).\n\nWe thank S. Brauer for technical assistance, M.

Here, we present the results of a diagenetic model in which tubeworm aggregation persistence is achieved through augmentation of the supply of sulfate to hydrocarbon seep sediments. In the model, L. luymesi releases the sulfate generated by its internal, chemoautotrophic, sulfide-oxidizing symbionts through posterior root-like extensions of its body. The sulfate fuels sulfate reduction, commonly coupled to anaerobic methane oxidation and hydrocarbon degradation by bacterial\u2013archaeal consortia. If sulfate is released by the tubeworms, sulfide generation mainly by hydrocarbon degradation is sufficient to support moderate-sized aggregations of L. luymesi for hundreds of years. The results of this model expand our concept of the potential benefits derived from complex interspecific relationships, in this case involving members of all three domains of life.\n\nModeling the interactions between deep-sea tubeworms and bacteria/archaea at hydrocarbon seeps provides a solution to their long term energy source and could help to explain the tubeworm's extreme longevity\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nComplex positive species interactions have been shown to expand the ecological niche and increase the persistence of the organisms involved in a variety of systems. In terrestrial systems, increased diversity of mycorrhizal symbionts is correlated with increased biodiversity of plant communities, resulting in greater stability and longer persistence at the community level [1]. In marine ecosystems, the coral Oculina arbuscula harbors a majid crab, Mithrax forceps, that prevents overgrowth of macroalgae and shading of the corals [2]. This allows O. arbuscula to maintain its facultative mutualism with photosynthetic zooxanthellae in well-lit habitats off the Atlantic coast of North Carolina, increasing the amount of energy available to the coral for growth and reproduction. At cold seeps in the Cascadia [3,4] and Aleutian [5] subduction zones, bioirrigation through burrow formation and bioturbation by clams (Calyptogena spp.) has been shown to significantly affect the distribution of microbial anaerobic methane oxidation.\n\n\nLamellibrachia luymesi inhabits areas associated with advection of hydrocarbons and other reduced chemicals to the seafloor (hydrocarbon or brine seeps) on the upper Louisiana slope (ULS) of the Gulf of Mexico from 400 to 1,000 m depth. L. luymesi does not posses a digestive system; rather, it acquires energy via internal sulfide-oxidizing bacterial symbionts [6]. L. luymesi differs from other vestimentiferan tubeworms by its ability to use a posterior extension of its body, the \u201croot,\u201d to acquire sulfide from interstitial pools in sediments [7,8]. Near the anterior plumes of tubeworms, sulfide concentrations typically decline below 0.1 \u03bcM as the tubeworms approach 1 m in length [9]. By using its roots, L. luymesi is able to delve into deeper sediment layers, providing access to more persistent sulfide sources. In the apparent absence of lethal predation [10,11], the most significant hazard that this vestimentiferan tubeworm faces is sulfide limitation. Its high uptake rate of sulfide from hydrocarbon seep sediments, estimated at over 30 \u03bcmol \u00b7 h\u22121 for a moderate-sized individual [12], suggests that sulfide flux may be limiting in L. luymesi's habitat.\n\nA diverse chemosynthetic community relies on the sulfide generated as a by-product of anaerobic degradative processes in the Gulf of Mexico [10,11]. Reduction of seawater sulfate utilizing methane or other hydrocarbons as electron donors produces the majority of sulfide available at ULS seeps [13,14]. Anaerobic methane oxidation is most commonly carried out by microbial consortia consisting of sulfate-reducing bacteria along with methanogenic archaea executing reverse methanogenesis [15,16]. Methane oxidation linked to sulfate reduction and subsequent authigenic carbonate precipitation constrain ocean\u2013atmosphere carbon fluxes [3,4], accounting for up to 20% of the global methane flux to the atmosphere [17]. Oxidation of other hydrocarbons and organic material, carried out by sulfate-reducing bacteria in monoculture and in consortia with other microbes [18], may account for a larger proportion of sulfate depletion in ULS sediments [14]. These processes can result in a decoupling of sulfate reduction and methane oxidation rates [14], and form carbonates consisting mainly of non-methane-derived carbon [19]. L. luymesi may influence these anaerobic processes by utilizing its roots to release the sulfate generated by its symbionts during sulfide oxidation [7,8,12]. This hypothetical mechanism would provide sulfate for anaerobic methane oxidation and hydrocarbon degradation at sediment depths normally devoid of energetically favorable oxidants, thereby augmenting exogenous sulfide production.\n\nIn this study, we address the question of whether known biogeochemical processes could supply sulfide at rates sufficient to match the requirements of long-lived L. luymesi aggregations. In the diagenetic model presented here, the hypothesized release of sulfate in sediments with sufficient electron donors results in sulfide generation at rates matching the sulfide uptake rate of L. luymesi aggregations for over 250 y. We speculate that the mutual benefits derived from the syntrophy among symbiotic tubeworms and microbial consortia implicit in the model would expand our current concept for the potential complexity of positive interspecific interactions and the benefits they confer.\n\nResults/Discussion\n\nL. luymesi Sulfate Release Allows Persistence of Aggregations\nThe model predicts that inputs from known sources, including diffusion and advection of deep sulfide along with reduced seawater sulfate, will support a moderately-sized aggregation of 1,000 individuals for an average of 39 y (range, 22 to 78 y) (Figure 1). A smaller aggregation of 200 individuals could be maintained with these sources for an average of 64.1 y (standard deviation, 10.6 y). In this model configuration, the duration of adequate sulfide flux is not congruent with the known sizes of aggregations and existing age estimates of L. luymesi individuals and aggregations. Adding sulfate release by tubeworm roots to the model results in sulfide generation and flux at rates that match the demands of large aggregations, allowing the tubeworms to survive for over 250 y (Figure 1). This additional source of sulfate results in a two-orders-of-magnitude increase in sulfate flux in older (>100 y) aggregations, accounting for over 90% of sulfate available after only 24 y. The sulfate released by the tubeworms would be used for anaerobic methane oxidation and hydrocarbon degradation. The nature of the relationship between symbiotic tubeworms and microbial consortia that we are proposing is a coupling of the sulfur cycle only, and not carbon. Light dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) resulting from the oxidation of hydrocarbons is apparently not taken up by tubeworms as the carbon stable isotope signatures of L. luymesi are heavier than would be expected from a methane-derived DIC source [20,21]. In addition, the well-studied hydrothermal vent tubeworm, Riftia pachyptila, obtains carbon in the form of CO2 across its plume [22]. However, this does not necessarily exclude the passive diffusion of DIC across the root surface, which could account for some of the variability observed in L. luymesi carbon stable isotope signatures [20,21]. By augmenting the sulfate supply to microbial consortia for sulfate reduction, large aggregations of tubeworms may survive for hundreds of years in the model, mirroring the population sizes and individual lengths regularly observed and collected at seeps on the ULS [23].\n\nFigure 1 Ratio of Sulfide Supply to Sulfide Uptake Rate of L. luymesi Aggregations\nEquilibrium line (1:1 ratio) and average, maximum, and minimum values for 1,000 iterations presented. Supply rate based on known sources without sulfate release by tubeworm roots shown in blue. Sulfide supply declines below demand after approximately 40 y. Supply rate including sulfate release from tubeworm roots shown in red, with sulfate release constrained by tubeworm symbionts' sulfide oxidation rate. Sulfide supply exceeds demand for the duration of the model.\n\nModel Results Are Robust to Parameter Variation\nAn alternate hypothesis to explain the discordance between estimated sulfide supply and uptake rates is the presence of locally elevated seepage rates. Sensitivity analyses were carried out to determine the potential effects of uncertainty in seepage rate on supply estimated for aggregations without root sulfate release. A 10% increase in seepage rate resulted in a 5.6% increase in sulfide supply to aggregations 200 y old and older. This corresponds to only 16.4% of the sulfide required, which does not serve to extend aggregation survivorship (average, 39 y; range, 21 to 79 y) beyond that determined for lower flow rates. To supply the sulfide flux required by older aggregations, seepage rate would have to be at least 363 mm \u00b7 y\u22121. This is over ten times greater than the rate used in the model (32 mm \u00b7 y\u22121), which is the highest region-wide estimate for the Gulf of Mexico [24]. A rate of over 300 mm \u00b7 y\u22121 approaches rates reported for active venting of fluids (Table 1). Active venting would result in the visual manifestation of seepage in the form of methane bubbles and oil droplets, which are generally restricted to mussel (Bathymodiolus childressi) beds at these sites [25]. In addition, larger, and therefore older [26], aggregations have lower epibenthic sulfide concentrations [8,9,25] suggesting that seepage becomes less vigorous over time and is not in the form of active venting in larger tubeworm aggregations. While difficult to obtain, in situ measures of advection rate of fluids at Gulf of Mexico seeps could be used to test these assumptions and may lend insight into the relationship between variability in tubeworm growth rate and sulfide availability.\n\nTable 1 Reported Seepage Rates for Hydrocarbon and Methane Seeps\nThe high degree of variability in growth rate and recruitment rate could also affect the ratio of supply and demand in the model. In an aggregation exhibiting anomalously low recruitment, the size of the rhizosphere would increase more rapidly than the biomass of the aggregation. This would lead to high rates of sulfide delivery and generation and low rates of sulfide uptake by tubeworm roots. When initial recruitment rate (a in equations 1 and 2) is decreased by 10%, the length of time that supply exceeds demand increases by 3.7%. This effect appears to be linear, with a 20% decrease in initial recruitment rate resulting in a 7.4% increase in persistence. If growth rate is increased, thereby increasing the rate of rhizosphere growth in terms of surface area for diffusion and advection, there appears to be little effect of the ratio of supply to demand (20% increase in growth\u20140% change in persistence time). In fact, increasing growth to the upper limits of the error term (equation 5) lowers the amount of time that the aggregation can be supported since biomass and sulfide demand increase more rapidly than increases in supply resulting from additional surface area. By decreasing growth rate, aggregations may be supported for longer periods of time, with a 20% decrease leading to a 6.3% increase in persistence time and a decrease of 88% leading to persistence for over 250 y. While an 88% lower growth rate lies outside of the range of existing growth data, this could be accomplished by ceasing growth for extended periods of time in a quiescent stage. This possibility remains to be investigated in L. luymesi. By utilizing a variable recruitment rate in the model, both between realized aggregations and between years within a model run, along with a growth error term encompassing the full range of observed growth data, the model is capable of generating aggregations within the range of the 10%\u201320% variability tested in this analysis. Even these outlying aggregations (presented as maxima and minima in Figure 1) support the qualitative conclusions drawn from model results.\n\nWhile the model was based on empirical data to the greatest degree possible, estimates of many of the parameters necessary to resolve the model were not available or are extremely difficult to measure in deep water with existing technology. Uptake rates were measured in the laboratory [8] for relatively small individuals (<50 cm). While we attempted to approximate metabolic scaling by covarying uptake and growth rates, it is possible that large individuals require even lower sulfide flux. Model predictions are not overly sensitive to variability in this parameter. A reduction by 10% of the overall sulfide uptake rate results in a 5.2% increase in persistence time. To maintain an aggregation for over 250 y, mass-specific uptake rate would have to be reduced 6-fold. While this could also be accomplished by entering a period of quiescence as mentioned before, there is no existing evidence for this ability in vestimentiferans.\n\nThe second version of the model is based on the assumption that L. luymesi is capable of releasing sulfate through its roots. It should be noted that in the model, sulfate release is constrained by the rate of sulfate generation by the tubeworm's sulfide-oxidizing symbionts, resulting in the near 1:1 ratio of supply and demand in Figure 1. Though modeled sulfate flux across the roots into the rhizosphere may exceed 20 mmol \u00b7 h\u22121 in older aggregations, the roots provide an ample respiratory surface such that rates of sulfate flux per unit root surface area do not exceed 0.4 \u03bcmol \u00b7 h\u22121\u00b7 cm\u22122 in the model. It remains possible that a proportion of the sulfate could be released through the plume of the tubeworms, though the energy required to pump sulfate against a concentration gradient (seawater [SO4] = 29 mM) [13] suggests that it would be more energetically favorable for the sulfate to passively diffuse out of the roots. It is also possible that sulfate flux could be increased by active bioirrigation delivering seawater to deeper sediment layers through the tubeworm tubes. This could allow the sulfide-oxidizing symbionts to store some of the oxidized sulfide as elemental sulfur rather than releasing it as sulfate, while maintaining sufficient sulfate flux to deeper sediment layers for sulfide generation. These mechanisms remain hypothetical and require further experimental investigations to evaluate their potential role in this system.\n\nTubeworms Impact Seep Biogeochemistry\nTubeworm sulfate release, in conjunction with high sulfide uptake rates, could contribute to the observation of declining advection rate in older aggregations. By increasing sulfate flux to deeper sediments, L. luymesi increases integrated rates of anaerobic methane oxidation and hydrocarbon degradation, which would enhance authigenic calcium carbonate precipitation within the rhizosphere. Under the conditions of root sulfate release in the model, calcium carbonate precipitation is rapid (0.109 to 0.316 \u03bcmol \u00b7 l\u22121 \u00b7 sec\u22121) in the first 53 y, with rates declining exponentially thereafter. By creating a barrier to fluid advection [4], this could result in the observed decrease in epibenthic sulfide concentration in older aggregations [8,9] and the predicted cessation of tubeworm recruitment around this time [12,23].\n\nIn order to prevent the precipitation of carbonate directly on the root surface, L. luymesi individuals may release hydrogen ions as well as sulfate through their roots. While hydrogen ion flux through the roots has not yet been empirically demonstrated, none of the nearly 5,000 tubeworms examined as part of this study were observed to have carbonate formed directly on their roots, suggesting that this form of precipitation is inhibited in some manner. In the model, diffusion of hydrogen ions across the root surface (the only form of release explicitly modeled) accounts for less than 40% of ion generation when carbonate precipitation is most vigorous. We speculate that L. luymesi may utilize the excess hydrogen ions generated by their sulfide-oxidizing symbionts to periodically raise the rate of hydrogen ion flux from their roots. This would not only supply additional hydrogen ions to sulfate-reducing bacteria, but could inhibit carbonate precipitation on the tubes and subsequent reduction of the root area utilizable as a respiratory surface. Further pH reduction could dissolve existing carbonate in sediments beneath the rhizosphere, thereby opening seepage pathways and allowing further root growth. This possibility is corroborated by the observation of young tubeworms that had apparently bored through bivalve shells in an experimental system (R. Carney, personal communication). Empirical measurements of hydrogen ion flux across the root tissue of L. luymesi are required to test these hypothetical mechanisms.\n\nThe release of sulfate by tubeworm roots potentially explains the frequent observation of highly degraded hydrocarbons in the vicinity of large tubeworm aggregations [27]. The majority of sulfate supplied by tubeworm roots is utilized for microbial hydrocarbon degradation in the model (Figure2). This process alone accounts for over 60% of the sulfide available to aggregations after approximately 80 y. In the absence of liquid and solid phase hydrocarbons, methane flux would have to be approximately four times the rate in the model in order to fuel sufficient sulfate reduction to support an aggregation for over 200 y. This could occur in sediments overlying rapidly sublimating gas hydrates, and hydrate abundance has been previously suggested as a potential factor influencing the distribution of chemosynthetic communities in the Gulf of Mexico [10]. However, model results indicate that large chain hydrocarbons are the most significant energy source for sulfate reduction in tubeworm-dominated sediments. Increased integrated rates of hydrocarbon degradation would lead to highly biologically altered hydrocarbon pools among the roots of tubeworm aggregations. Hydrocarbon oxidation has been implicated as one of the dominant processes in the carbon cycle at ULS seeps, accounting for over 90% of the carbon in carbonates collected in the vicinity of tubeworm aggregations [19]. Model analysis indicates that the minimum amount of organic carbon (including hydrocarbons as well as buried organic material) in sediments required to supply sulfide at rates matching aggregation demand (1:1 supply:uptake ratio) is 1.03% by weight, remarkably close to the lowest value found in any of the seep sediment core samples (1.2%) [13,28], and greater than that found in ULS sediments away from seeps (0.71%) [29]. Determination of organic carbon concentration in sediments beneath tubeworm aggregations is necessary to test the prediction that elevated carbon content at seeps, primarily resulting from oil seepage, provides the energy source required to generate sufficient sulfide for tubeworm aggregations.\n\nFigure 2 Sources of Sulfide Available to Tubeworm Aggregations over Time in the Model\nSources of sulfide include advection and diffusion of sulfide from deep sources (yellow) or sulfate reduction using methane (blue), buried organic carbon (green), or C6+ hydrocarbons (dark grey) as electron donors. Sulfate is provided by diffusion from sediments surrounding the rhizosphere, diffusion at the sediment\u2013water interface, and release from tubeworm roots.\n\nAdditional sulfate flux from tubeworm roots could also explain the high apparent sulfate diffusion coefficients determined for tubeworm-impacted sediments [13]. Anomalous sulfate fluxes have been proposed to be a result of bioturbation and bioirrigation by macrofauna [3,5], and recycling by microbial mats [13]. The results of the model presented here provide evidence for macrofaunal sulfur recycling, an additional component to be considered in future investigations of cold seep biogeochemistry. The hypothesized release of sulfate by tubeworm roots potentially explains numerous, apparently disparate observations, hinting at the great impact that L. luymesi aggregations may have on their abiotic environment.\n\nWhile the proposed interactions between symbiotic tubeworms and sulfate-reducing bacteria are essential for the persistence of L. luymesi aggregations in the model, we suggest that there are significant effects on the microbial community as well. This syntrophy will increase the abundance of sulfate-reducing bacteria and therefore increase the rates of anaerobic methane oxidation and hydrocarbon degradation carried out by microbial consortia that rely on sulfate as an oxidant. Tubeworm-generated sulfate supplies a more energetically favorable electron acceptor below the normal depth of sulfate penetration at seeps, relaxing the limitation on anaerobic oxidative processes at these sediment depths. Deeper sediment layers then become habitable to sulfate reducers, significantly altering the microbial community structure within the rhizosphere. Model configurations neglect the potential role of bioirrigation of seawater sulfate through L. luymesi tubes, which could further increase sulfate supply to deeper sediment layers. The possible role of tubeworm roots as substrata for the growth of microbial consortia, analogous to the habitat afforded mycorrhizal symbionts of higher plants, remains another possible benefit for the microbes. These predictions may be tested by determination of the relative abundance of microbial consortia at different depths of sediments both impacted by and isolated from tubeworms. Localization of the microbes on the root surface would provide evidence for a more intricate relationship. It is our hope that the results of this model may provide the impetus for future rigorous experimental tests of these ideas.\n\nSummary\nThe model results presented here are consistent with the hypothesis that L. luymesi releases sulfate into hydrocarbon-rich sediments to fuel sulfide generation, allowing for the persistence of the longest-lived animal known. The importance of this process to sulfide generation in the modeled rhizosphere implies a complex relationship between an animal with bacterial endosymbionts and external sulfate-reducing bacteria, often in consortia with methane-oxidizing or hydrocarbon-degrading microbes. This positive interspecific relationship, including members of all three domains, would benefit both the tubeworms and the microbial consortia involved. This expands our existing concept of the potential for complexity in mutualisms and the benefits they may confer. Further complex relationships are likely to be discovered through continued research into the role of positive species interactions at the individual and community levels.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nThis study couples an individual-based population growth and sulfide uptake model [12] to a diagenetic diffusion/advection model to compare the relative magnitude of sulfide supply and uptake for long-lived tubeworm aggregations. A series of 1,000 iterations of the model under three different initial conditions (known sources of sulfate, known sources plus root sulfate supply, and known sources with elevated seepage rates) were carried out. The rhizosphere (volume of sediment encompassed by the root system of an aggregation) is modeled as an inverted dome beneath the sediment with a radius equal to the average root length of the population (Figure 3). The rhizosphere was approximated by a series of two-dimensional discs at 2-cm intervals in order to reduce the complexity of a three-dimensional solution for a sphere of changing size. Sulfate (SO4\n2\u2212), methane (CH4), sulfide (HS\u2212), bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212), and hydrogen ion (H+) fluxes across the rhizosphere boundary are determined. Sulfate reduction rates using methane, larger chain hydrocarbons, and buried organic matter as electron donors are modeled in order to estimate the sulfide available to tubeworm aggregations as they change in size over the course of 250 y.\n\nFigure 3 Model Construction\nPopulation model includes individual size-specific growth and mortality rates, and population size-specific recruitment rate. Growth rate was determined by in situ staining of tubeworm aggregations using a blue chitin stain (in situ photograph of stained aggregation demonstrating annual growth shown here) and collection after 12\u201314 mo. Diagenetic model included advection and diffusion of sulfate, sulfide, methane, bicarbonate, and hydrogen ions as well as organic carbon content of sediments. Fluxes across the rhizosphere (root system) boundary were compared to sulfide uptake rates for simulated aggregations to determine whether sulfide supply could match the required uptake rates of aggregations (for specific methodology see methods). HC, C6+ hydrocarbons; orgC, organic carbon; ox, oxidation reaction; red, reduction reaction.\n\nPopulation growth model\nThe population growth model follows the methodology presented in [12] and includes population growth, mortality rate, individual growth rate, and sulfide uptake rate. The parameters underlying the population growth model were refined using growth data from an additional 615 individuals and population data from an additional 11 aggregations comprising 4,908 individuals. The model presented here includes data from a total of 23 tubeworm aggregations from three nearby sites (Green Canyon oil lease blocks 184, 232, and 234) collected over a period of 7 y on the ULS to arrive at generalized population growth parameters.\n\n\nL. luymesi individuals are dioecious, with males releasing sperm into the water column. Fertilization is believed to be external [30], though sperm has been found within the oviducts of females of the hydrothermal vent tubeworm R. pachyptila [31]. Eggs and embryos are positively buoyant and develop into a swimming trochophore-like larval stage within 3 d of fertilization [32]. Larvae are lecithotrophic and may remain in the water column for several weeks [32]. They require hard substrata for settlement, and acquire symbionts from their environment after metamorphosis [33,34]. Settlement is initially rapid, and continues until the available substrate is occupied [12,23,35]. Population sizes of aggregations collected with existing sampling devices typically vary between 100 and 1,500 individuals ([12,23]; this study), though far larger aggregations covering tens to hundreds of square meters are common at the sites sampled. Previous studies have shown that L. luymesi has an average longevity of 135 y [12], and requires an average of 210 y to reach 2 m in length [26], a size not uncommon among collected animals. Mortality events are exceedingly rare, dropping below 1% annual mortality probability for animals over 30 cm [12]. The expanded datasets of growth and mortality rates included here extend the longevity estimate for L. luymesi to an average of 176 y and the estimated age of a 2-m-long animal to 216 y.\n\nAt the beginning of each iteration, population growth parameters are chosen for the following population growth model:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere N is population size, t is time (in years), K is carrying capacity (set to 1,000 individuals for all simulations presented here), a describes the initial slope of the line, b defines the degree of density dependence, and c is a shape parameter. The first parameter (a) was generated using the following function:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere \u025b[N(0,1)] is a normally distributed random deviate with an average of zero and a standard deviation of one. This allows the initial recruitment rate to vary within the range of all recruitment trajectories that have been observed [12]. The other parameters were not normally distributed; therefore, the log-transformed distributions were used to define the distribution of the random numbers generated. As the three parameters in the model were significantly correlated (ln(a) and ln(b), r = \u22120.853, p < 0.001; ln(a) and ln (c), r = \u22120.461, p = 0.036), values of b and c were chosen from their relationship with a:\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe value of a was allowed to vary each year according to the pooled standard error associated with the estimates of a from the empirical data (standard error, 0.105). Once population size equaled or exceeded carrying capacity, recruitment was ceased, representing the lack of additional substrate or sulfide available in the water column.\n\nOnce recruitment was determined for that year, the individual-based portion of the model began. Each individual was traced through time with respect to its length, root length, mass, mortality probability, mass-specific sulfide uptake rate, sulfate excretion rate, and hydrogen ion elimination rate. Growth rates of tubeworms were determined by staining tubes in situ (Figure 3) and collection 12 to 14 mo later ([26]; this study). Individual growth rate was determined from the following function (Figure 4):\n\nFigure 4 \nL. luymesi Growth Rate\nSize-specific growth of L. luymesi determined from stained tubeworms. Different colors indicate growth data from different aggregations. Blue points labeled \u201c2000\u201d are all from Bergquist et al. [26]. Other colored points refer to submersible dive numbers from 2003 when stained aggregations were collected.\n\n(A) Growth function and 95% confidence interval for size-specific growth.\n\n(B) Error function fitted to the residuals of the model.\n\n\n  \n\n\nLength (l) is defined here as the distance from the anterior end of the tube to an outer tube diameter of 2 mm following the methodology of [26]. All growth rates were standardized to 365 d. The error term is an additional function fitted to the residuals of the first regression function (Figure 4B), resulting in a variable growth rate. This error term was used rather than varying growth within the 95% confidence interval of the regression of length and growth rate because of the high degree of variability in growth among individuals. It should also be noted that there is a certain degree of variability in growth rate between aggregations (Figure 4). This may be attributable to spatial or temporal variability in seepage rate or sulfide concentration between aggregations. Aggregations may be subject to persistently differing conditions on a small (meter) scale, or may encounter periodic fluctuations in habitat characteristics. Because we are uncertain whether this variation is persistent on the temporal scales that we are simulating, between-aggregation variability is not explicitly modeled, though by chance certain realized aggregations deviated from mean growth rate.\n\nThe ratio of root length to tube length was determined from individual length using the following function:\n\n\n  \n\n\nAnnual mortality rate was approximated as the size-specific frequency of empty tubes in collected aggregations [12] with an overall annual mortality rate of 0.569%. This approximation is conservative and likely overestimates yearly mortality, as available data indicate that empty tubes should persist longer than 1 y [12,36]. Mortality probability was determined for each 10-cm size class using the following function:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere m is mortality probability and l is length. Individuals were considered dead if their probability of mortality exceeded a uniform random number between zero and one.\n\nBy using generalized population growth parameters in the model presented here, we attempt to encompass the range of empirical data from sampled aggregations in our examination of sulfide uptake and supply rates. Taken together, the population growth model including recruitment, growth, and mortality provides a good qualitative if not quantitative fit for any individual aggregation, reflecting the size frequency of tubeworms within sampled aggregations [12]. It should be noted that the modeling of specific aggregations was not the aim of this study; rather, an attempt has been made to encompass the variability observed in the various populations of tubeworms that have been sampled. To examine the effect of uncertainty in the population growth parameters, sensitivity analyses were carried out. The initial slope of the recruitment rate (a in equation 1) was varied while individual size-specific growth rate was held constant (no error term in equation 5). Growth rate was then varied while holding the initial rate of population growth constant (no error term in equation 2). The effect of a 10% change in each parameter was determined, and then changes of greater magnitude were examined to determine the fastest rate of population or individual growth that could be supported by the sulfide available to the aggregation in the absence of sulfate release.\n\nIndividual sulfide uptake was allowed to vary within the range of laboratory-determined sulfide uptake rates according to that individual's growth rate for that year:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere u is uptake rate (in micromoles per gram per hour), m is mass (in grams), and g is growth rate (in centimeters per year). Growth rate was divided by the maximum growth rate (10 cm \u00b7 y\u22121) such that highest growth rates resulted in highest uptake rates. By scaling uptake rate with growth, we approximate metabolic scaling, resulting in a decline in uptake rate by a factor of 3.7 over the range of tubeworm sizes in this study [12]. The amount of sulfate that could be excreted by each individual was determined from the amount generated by sulfide oxidation carried out by the internal chemoautotrophic symbionts assuming constant internal sulfate concentration, thereby accounting for changes in body volume. We do not account for the binding of sulfur by free amino acids, as this is believed to relatively minor compared the flux rates of sulfate and sulfide, and is reversible [37]. Hydrogen ions are also generated in the oxidation of sulfide by the tubeworm symbionts. Hydrogen ion elimination rate was determined in the model in the same fashion as sulfide uptake, with growth rate determining the variability in this metabolic flux according to laboratory-measured ion fluxes (mean, 10.96 \u03bcmol \u00b7 g\u22121 \u00b7 h\u22121; standard deviation, 1.88 \u03bcmol \u00b7 g\u22121 \u00b7 h\u22121) [38]. Simple diffusion of hydrogen ions across the root surface was included in the model, though the exact mode of proton flux has not yet been determined experimentally for L. luymesi [38]. As diffusion across the roots accounts for a relatively small proportion of total proton flux (less than 10% in large individuals), additional pathways are likely and require further investigation.\n\nGeochemical setting\nKnown sources of sulfide available to L. luymesi aggregations are sulfide transported with seeping fluids [10] and sulfide generated via reduction of seawater sulfate [39,40]. The majority of the sulfide present at ULS sites is believed to be related to sulfate reduction coupled to anaerobic hydrocarbon oxidation [14,39]. Other potential sources of sulfide associated with seepage include anaerobic oxidation of deeply buried organic material [10], \u201csour\u201d hydrocarbons containing a proportion of sulfur [41], and hydrocarbon interactions with sulfur-bearing minerals such as gypsum and anhydrite found in the salt dome cap rocks of the ULS [8,42,43].\n\nConcentrations of all chemical species in the sediments surrounding the rhizosphere were derived from the dataset included in Arvidson et al. [13] and Morse et al. [28]. Only those sediment cores taken around the \u201cdrip line\u201d of tubeworm aggregations that contained detectable sulfide concentrations were used. Due to the vagaries of sampling with a submersible in sediments heavily impacted by carbonate and roots, those cores with detectable sulfide are believed to more accurately represent conditions around the periphery of the rhizosphere.\n\nDissolved organic carbon (DOC) concentration was used as an estimate of methane concentration. While other forms of DOC make up this total concentration, methane accounts for 90%\u201395% of the hydrocarbon gasses dissolved in pore waters [28]. In seep sediments, the majority of DOC is likely to be in the form of hydrocarbon gasses. Because estimates of organic acid concentrations were not available, they could not be explicitly modeled. This would not affect the overall concentration of electron donors in the model, but could affect the sulfate reduction rate. Since sulfate reduction rate estimates for methane seeps in the Gulf of Mexico are among the highest recorded [14,39], any differences in DOC composition (e.g., higher relative concentrations of dissolved organic acids) would serve to lower the overall sulfate reduction rate and sulfide availability. Sulfide supply estimates presented are likely overestimated most by the model without root sulfate release owing to the greater reliance on anaerobic methane oxidation in this form of the model. Simulations including sulfate release by tubeworms are affected to a lesser extent as the concentration of electron donors is not limiting in this model configuration.\n\nSolid and liquid phase organic carbon was separated into hydrocarbons and buried organic material according to their relative concentrations in hydrocarbon seep and surrounding Gulf of Mexico sediments. Background sediments on the ULS contain 0.71% organic carbon by weight [29]. At hydrocarbon seeps on the ULS, organic carbon accounts for 4.47% of total weight. This was assumed to be the sum of background organic input plus carbon in the form of C6+ hydrocarbons. It is possible that the higher biomass located at ULS seeps in the form of non-living macrofaunal and microbial materials may also contribute to the increased organic carbon concentration, but without empirical estimates, this could not be accounted for in the model. Hydrocarbons may consist of between 50% and 95% labile materials [44,45,46]. Based on existing data on degradation rates and residual hydrocarbons subjected to degradation [42,47], a value of 50% labile material was used here. These assumptions of hydrocarbon concentration and degradation potential are therefore believed to be conservative.\n\nThe following functions were fitted to the sulfide, sulfate, and methane concentration profiles (Figure 5) to determine the boundary conditions at any given depth:\n\nFigure 5 Concentration Profiles of Sulfate, Sulfide, and DOC\nPoints represent average concentration at a given depth from 13 sediment cores taken around the periphery of tubeworm aggregations (see Materials and Methods and original data in [13,28]). Best-fitted line based on least squares fit of equation 9.\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere C\n0 is initial concentration, C\u221e is concentration at infinite distance, and Ci is concentration at depth d. As there were no existing data for sediments below 30 cm, concentrations at infinite depth (C\u221e) were used (SO4\n2\u2212 = 0 mmol \u00b7 l\u22121, HS\u2212 = 12 mmol \u00b7 l\u22121, DOC = 11 mmol \u00b7 l\u22121, DIC = 20 mmol \u00b7 l\u22121, pH = 7.78). The first derivatives of the sulfide and methane profiles were used for the calculation of advective flux from depth. The first derivative of the sulfate profile was used for diffusive flux across the water\u2013sediment interface of the rhizosphere, with advection rate subtracted from diffusive flux of sulfate across this surface. Advection (seepage) rate varied with time according to the following function:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere t is simulation time in years and sed is sedimentation rate (6 cm \u00b7 1,000 y\u22121) [29]. Early seepage rate approximated the highest flux rates measured or estimated for methane seeps and declined with time in the model to the highest estimates for persistent, region-wide seepage in the Gulf of Mexico (Table 1). This follows a pattern of hydrocarbon seep development, with the highest seepage rates early in the evolution of the local seepage source followed by occlusion of fluid migration pathways by carbonate precipitation, hydrate formation, and possibly tubeworm root growth. By using the highest rate estimated (32 mm \u00b7 y\u22121 = 0.000365 cm \u00b7 h\u22121 in equation 10) as the basal seepage rate, we are testing the possibility that tubeworm aggregations could survive under the most favorable conditions possible in the absence of tubeworm sulfate supply.\n\nFor sediments encompassed by the rhizosphere, sulfide, sulfate, methane, DOC, and hydrogen ion concentration profiles were determined iteratively prior to model implementation using a central difference scheme:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere C\ni(t) is concentration in cell i at time t, D is the diffusion coefficient, k is the maximum reaction rate, and Ks is the half-saturation constant for the reaction (Table 2). Reactions included anaerobic methane oxidation (equation 17), tubeworm sulfide uptake rate (equation 8), and carbonate precipitation rate (equation 22). The concentration in each 2 \u00d7 2 cm cell was calculated at 1 h time steps. At the end of each year, diffusion distance increased. The number of cells (total diffusion distance) was determined by the average root length of L. luymesi populations as realized in independent runs of the population growth model described above, and included here as model input only. A separate function was fitted to each of the concentration profiles:\n\nTable 2 Parameters Involved in Diagenetic Model\n\naDiffusion coefficients all corrected for temperature, pressure, and salinity according to Stumm and Morgan [51] and Pilson [52]\n\n\nbAll disassociation constants corrected for temperature, salinity, and pressure according to Stumm and Morgan [51] and Pilson [52] except: CaOH, no correction; CaHCO3, CaSO4, CaSO4H2O, MgHCO3, temperature only; H2CO3, temperature and salinity only; and HSO4, temperature and pressure only\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere d is radial distance. The relationship between the parameter a and distance was used to generate concentration profiles for each disc comprising the rhizosphere. Because of the tight linear relationship between diffusion distance and the shape of the curve, concentration profiles could be generated for a disc of any size using the following function:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere \u03b1 is 1.7344 and \u03b2 is 1.0104 for HS\u2212, \u03b1 is 0.2111 and \u03b2 is 0.3363 for SO4\n2\u2212, and \u03b1 is 0.1626 and \u03b2 is 0.2518 for CH4. Diffusional fluxes of sulfide, sulfate, and methane were calculated according to the first and second derivatives of the concentration profiles as determined by the diameter of each disc.\n\nModel implementation\nThe model estimates sulfide availability to the aggregation as a whole by summing the fluxes separately determined for each 2-cm disc composing the rhizosphere. Depth-dependant boundary conditions were set for each disc separately based on the sediment profiles (Figure 5). Diffusional fluxes into each disc were calculated from the shape of the concentration profiles according to the following function [48]:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere C is concentration, r is disc radius, and Ds is the diffusion coefficient corrected for porosity by:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere Do is the diffusion coefficient corrected for temperature and pressure, n is the chemical species-specific constant, and \u03c6 is porosity. The value of n was set to 2.75 as this was found to be a reasonable fit for all chemical species examined [49]. The ionic states of each species at the average pH value of tubeworm-dominated sediments (7.78) were used for the determination of diffusion coefficients. Porosity was determined from the following function:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere \u03c6z is porosity at depth z, \u03c60 is porosity at the sediment\u2013water interface, and \u03c6\u221e is porosity at infinite depth; \u03c60 was set at 0.841, \u03c6\u221e at 0.765, and a at 0.210, as determined from the best fit with the porosity data (Figure 6) from Morse et al. [28].\n\nFigure 6 Sediment Porosity Values\nPoints represent average porosity at a given depth from 13 sediment cores taken around the periphery of tubeworm aggregations (see Materials and Methods and original data in [13,28]). Best-fitted line based on least squares fit of equation 9.\n\nDiffusion across the sediment\u2013water interface of the rhizosphere was also considered as an additional input of sulfate and hydrogen ions. This was included as one-dimensional diffusion across a circular surface (subtracting the area encompassed by the tubeworm tubes) with diffusion distance equal to rhizosphere diameter, and concentration differential from seawater concentration to the average concentration within the rhizosphere. Sulfate and hydrogen ion diffusion across the root surface was then added (if included in the set of model realizations) as simple Fickian diffusion. Concentration differential was the difference between internal concentration and average concentration for each disc of the rhizosphere assuming roots were evenly proportioned according to the volume encompassed by each disc. Internal sulfate concentration and pH (Table 2) represented an average of the values determined for R. pachyptila [22], a hydrothermal vent tubeworm. Internal sulfate concentrations and pH of L. luymesi have not been reported, but these values are generally consistent within taxa [50]. Uptake of sulfide and release of sulfate were summed across the entire tubeworm population, again assuming an even distribution of roots within the rhizosphere. The paucity of empirical data on the location of any individual tubeworm's roots within an aggregation precluded modeling space explicitly; therefore, it is assumed that each individual has equal access to the resources available within the rhizosphere.\n\nWithin the rhizosphere, sulfide generation may be limited by sulfate supply, electron donor availability, or sulfate reduction rate. Sulfate supply was determined as the sum of flux across the series of discs approximating the rhizosphere dome, across the sediment\u2013water interface, and from root sulfate (if available). Available sulfate is utilized for anaerobic methane oxidation first (the more energetically favorable process), then hydrocarbon and organic matter degradation. Electron donors included methane, complex hydrocarbons, and buried organic material. Solid and liquid phase hydrocarbons and organic material were assumed to be homogenous within the rhizosphere. Methane supply was determined as the sum of flux across each rhizosphere disc boundary. Hydrocarbon and organic material concentrations were determined as the amounts encompassed within the rhizosphere volume minus that oxidized in previous years. Sulfate reduction rate was determined from the relative amounts of the various electron donors with higher rates (0.71 \u03bcmol \u00b7 ml\u22121 \u00b7 h\u22121) for methane oxidation and lower rates (0.083 \u03bcmol \u00b7 ml\u22121 \u00b7 h\u22121) for organic matter or hydrocarbon degradation [39]. Microbes carrying out these processes are assumed to be evenly distributed within the rhizosphere.\n\nTotal hydrogen sulfide availability to the aggregation was determined as the sum of sulfide diffusion and advection across each rhizosphere disc and sulfide generated within the rhizosphere from sulfate reduction according to the following reactions:\n\n\n SO42\u2212 + CH4 \u2192 HS\u2212 + HCO3\u2212 + H2O\n \n\n\n\n SO42\u2212 + 2CH2O \u2192 HS\u2212 + 2HCO3\u2212 + H2O\n \n\n\n\n SO42\u2212 + 1.47CnH2n+2 \u2192 HS\u2212 + 1.47HCO3\u2212 + H2O\n \n\n\nBicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212) is generated at a 1:1 stoichiometry during anaerobic methane oxidation and a 2:1 stoichiometry in the degradation of organic material. As hydrocarbons are degraded forming smaller chain hydrocarbons and organic acids, bicarbonate is generated at different stoichiometries. Because different-sized hydrocarbons and organic acids were not accounted for in the model, a rough average of these stoichiometries (1.47:1) based on toluene, ethylbenzene, xylene, and hexadecane degradation [18] was used to determine the amount of bicarbonate generated per mole of carbon. Hydrogen ions are also used up in a 1:1 stoichiometry with sulfate in the sulfate reduction half reaction as included in reaction 17.\n\nIn order to account for carbonate precipitation, the model traced DIC concentration, calcium concentration, hydrogen ion concentration, buffer capacity, carbonate saturation, and carbonate precipitation rate. The buffer state of the rhizosphere was calculated to determine changes in pH resulting from hydrogen ion flux. Buffer capacity (\u03b2) was calculated using the following function [51]:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere A and B represent the concentrations of the various acids and bases in the buffer system. In addition to hydrogen and hydroxyl ions, the buffer system included carbonate (CO2, H2CO3, HCO3\n\u2212, and CO3\n2\u2212), sulfide (H2S and HS\u2212), sulfate (HSO4\n\u2212 and SO4\n2\u2212), and borate (B[OH]4\n\u2212 and B[OH]3) speciation. Current pH was used to determine the ionic state of each species according to temperature-, pressure-, and salinity-corrected disassociation constants when available [51,52] (Table 2). Change in pH was determined from hydrogen ion flux and buffer capacity as follows:\n\n\n  \n\n\nSaturation state is highly dependent on the degree to which calcium and bicarbonate form complexes with other ions. The \u201cfree\u201d calcium was determined as the proportion of calcium that is not associated with complexed bicarbonate (HCO3\n\u2212), carbonate (CO3\n2\u2212), hydroxyl (OH\u2212), or sulfate (SO4\n2\u2212) ions. Free carbonate was determined as the amount not forming complexes with calcium (Ca+) or magnesium (Mg+) ions in solution. Saturation state was then calculated from the product of the concentrations of free calcium and carbonate divided by the solubility product constant. If the saturation state was above one, then carbonate precipitation occurred at a rate determined by:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere k\n1 is 0.00597 l \u00b7 mol\u22121 \u00b7 sec\u22121 and k3 = 0.456 l \u00b7 mol\u22121 \u00b7 sec\u22121 [51]. Because there is no empirical relationship between weight percent of carbonate and sediment porosity in tubeworm-dominated sediments [28], precipitation did not directly affect porosity. Precipitation was accounted for in the model by subtracting the volume of carbonate precipitate from the total volume encompassed by the rhizosphere.\n\nAt the end of each annual time step, model output included average length of individuals, population size, sulfide uptake rate, sulfide supply rate, root sulfate flux (if included), root hydrogen ion flux, amount of sulfide supply accounted for by each process (sulfide seepage, anaerobic methane oxidation, organic matter degradation, and hydrocarbon degradation), number of individuals that could be supported by sulfide supply, carbonate precipitation rate, volume of carbonate precipitate, and pH.\n\nWe would like to acknowledge K.

Most neurons respond maximally to sounds located far to the left or right side, with few neurons tuned to the frontal midline. Paradoxically, psychophysical studies show optimal spatial acuity across the frontal midline. In this paper, we revisit the problem of inhomogeneous spatial sampling in three fields of cat auditory cortex. In each field, we confirm that neural responses tend to be greatest for lateral positions, but show the greatest modulation for near-midline source locations. Moreover, identification of source locations based on cortical responses shows sharp discrimination of left from right but relatively inaccurate discrimination of locations within each half of space. Motivated by these findings, we explore an opponent-process theory in which sound-source locations are represented by differences in the activity of two broadly tuned channels formed by contra- and ipsilaterally preferring neurons. Finally, we demonstrate a simple model, based on spike-count differences across cortical populations, that provides bias-free, level-invariant localization\u2014and thus also a solution to the \u201cbinding problem\u201d of associating spatial information with other nonspatial attributes of sounds.\n\nA model relying on properties of auditory cortical neurons recorded in the cat can account for the accurate localization of sounds\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nTopographic representation is a hallmark of cortical organization: primary somatosensory cortex contains a somatotopic map of the body surface, primary visual cortex contains a retinotopic map of visual (retinal) space, and primary auditory cortex contains a cochleotopic map of sound frequency. The necessity of auditory cortex for normal sound localization (which is disrupted by cortical lesions [1,2,3]) strongly implies a cortical representation of auditory space. That representation has been reasonably expected to consist of a spatiotopic map, based on the existence of such maps in other sensory systems and on the view, proposed by Jeffress [4], that spatial processing in the auditory brainstem and midbrain might involve a \u201clocal code\u201d consisting of topographic maps of interaural spatial cues. A local code, or \u201cplace code,\u201d is one in which particular locations in space, or the spatial cues that correspond to those locations, are represented by neural activity at restricted locations in the brain. Evidence for local coding of auditory space has been demonstrated in mammalian superior colliculus [5,6] and in avian inferior colliculus (IC) [7,8] and optic tectum (homologous to mammalian superior colliculus) [9]. Nevertheless, local spatial coding has not thus far been demonstrated in the mammalian ascending auditory pathway.\n\nIf the Jeffress model is correct and a local code for spatial cues exists subcortically, one might anticipate local coding to be maintained in the cortex, where the various cues might finally be integrated into a coherent map of auditory space. Numerous studies, however, have failed to provide evidence for such a map. The spatial tuning of neurons is often characterized using rate\u2013azimuth functions (RAFs), which specify the average response rate (spikes per trial or per second) as a function of stimulus location in the horizontal dimension. Throughout the auditory cortex, such functions typically exhibit broad peaks (up to 180\u00b0 wide) that cover the contralateral hemifield and broaden further with increasing sound level [10,11,12,13,14]. Similar functions have been reported for cortical sensitivity to interaural cues [15,16], and for spatial and interaural sensitivity in the auditory brainstem and midbrain [17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24], thus questioning Jeffress's view of binaural processing in mammals. The emerging alternative view replaces the local code with a \u201cdistributed code,\u201d in which sound-source locations are represented by patterns of activity across populations of broadly tuned neurons [12,24,25].\n\nIn the past, we argued for a distributed spatial code in the auditory cortex in part because the broad spatial tuning of cortical neurons would seem to preclude the existence of a local code and also because individual neurons are able to transmit spatial information throughout much, if not all, of auditory space [25,26]. At least implicitly, we have advocated a uniform distributed code, assuming that uniform sampling of space by RAF peaks is required for maximally accurate spatial coding. Spatial centroids of neurons in the posterior auditory field (PAF), for example, sample space more uniformly than neurons in the primary auditory field (A1), and we have suggested that this feature partially underlies the increased ability of ensembles of PAF neurons to accurately signal sound-source locations [14].\n\nA number of observations demonstrate, however, that the auditory cortex samples space nonuniformly. RAFs are plotted for a selection of neurons in the dorsal zone (DZ) of auditory cortex in Figure 1, to illustrate a common observation of location-sensitive auditory cortical neurons: the majority favor contralateral stimulation, and typically exhibit either \u201chemifield\u201d or \u201caxial\u201d tuning [11], responding to stimuli located throughout contralateral space or near the acoustic axis of the contralateral pinna, respectively. A smaller number of ipsilaterally tuned units are also observed, the majority of which exhibit hemifield or axial tuning characteristics similar to those of contralateral units. In A1 and DZ, ipsilateral- and/or midline-tuned neurons may be arranged in bands\u2014parallel to the tonotopic axis\u2014that interdigitate with bands of contralaterally tuned cells [25,27,28,29]. The overall preponderance of contralateral tuning among cortical units seems to justify the view that each hemisphere represents the contralateral spatial hemifield, a view that is also supported by the contralateral sound-localization deficits that follow auditory cortical lesions [2,30,31]. Even within a single hemifield, however, no strong evidence for a topographic representation has been reported, and the observation that many units share similar hemifield RAFs demonstrates a profound inhomogeneity in the way cortical populations sample auditory space.\n\nFigure 1 Example RAFs\nPlotted are normalized mean spike counts (y-axis) elicited by broadband stimuli (20 dB above unit threshold) varying in azimuth (x-axis). Lines represent units recorded in cortical area DZ. Left: contralaterally responsive units. Right: ipsilaterally responsive units.\n\nAdditional evidence that the cortical representation of auditory space is inhomogeneous comes from studies of the ability of cortical responses to classify stimulus locations. Stecker et al. [14] found that the responses of most spatially sensitive units in cat cortical areas A1 and PAF could accurately discriminate the lateral hemifield (left versus right) of a stimulus, but often confused locations within the hemifield. This is shown for six PAF neurons represented by confusion matrices in Figure 2. Similarly, Middlebrooks et al. [12] measured median localization errors\u2014based on neural-network analyses of responses in the second auditory field (A2) and the field of the anterior ectosylvian sulcus (AES)\u2014between 37.5\u00b0 \u00b1 8.9\u00b0 and 43.7\u00b0\u00b1 10.2\u00b0, just under the theoretical limit of 45\u00b0 attainable through perfect left/right discrimination and within-hemifield confusion. Taken together, these results suggest that auditory space is represented within the cortex by a population of broadly tuned neurons, each of which is able to indicate the lateral hemifield from which a sound originated, but generally little more.\n\nFigure 2 Classification Performance of Accurate PAF Units from [14]\nNeural spike patterns were classified according to the stimulus location most likely to have elicited them. In each panel, a confusion matrix plots the relative proportion of classifications of each target azimuth (x-axis) to each possible response azimuth (y-axis). Proportions are indicated by the area of a circle located at the intersection of target and response locations. Example units were selected from among those transmitting the most spatial information in their responses. In each case, discrimination of contralateral azimuths (negative values) from ipsilateral azimuths (positive values) is apparent, accompanied by significant within-hemifield confusion. As such, neural responses are sufficient for left/right discrimination only, and the spatial information transmitted by the most accurate units tends not to be much greater than one bit per stimulus.\n\nResults/Discussion\nPreferred Locations Oversample Lateral Regions of Contralateral Space\u2014Steepest RAF Slopes Straddle the Midline\nThe idea that sound locations are signaled by the peaks of RAFs, which tend to be centered deep within the lateral hemifields, is at odds with localization behavior, which shows greatest resolution near the interaural midline [32,33]. An alternative view, however, has emerged for the processing of interaural time and level differences by cortical and subcortical neurons. In that view, locations are coded by the slopes, rather than the peaks, of rate\u2013interaural-time-difference or rate\u2013interaural-level-difference functions [22,24,34]. Moreover, these slopes appear aligned with the interaural midline and provide maximum spatial information in that region [20]. If a similar arrangement can explain the inhomogeneity of spatial sampling in the auditory cortex, then we would expect to find cortical RAF slopes to be steepest near the interaural midline as well.\n\nIn this report, we compare the responses of neurons in primary auditory cortex (A1) and two higher-order auditory cortical fields (PAF and DZ) in the cat. Compared to A1, areas PAF and DZ exhibit spectrotemporally complex responses that are significantly more sensitive to variations in sound-source location [14,25]. Therefore, these areas are the most likely candidate regions of cat auditory cortex for spatial specialization. PAF, in particular, appears necessary for sound localization by behaving cats [30].\n\n\nFigure 3 depicts the distribution of preferred locations (\u201cazimuth centroids\u201d; see [14]) along with locations of peak RAF slopes in all three fields. As we have reported previously, centroid distributions in Figure 3 reveal a preponderance of contralateral sensitivity regardless of cortical area or stimulus level [14,25]. Distributions of peak-slope location, however, are tightly clustered around the frontal midline (median\u00b1 standard error [see Materials and Methods] in A1, +15\u00b0 \u00b1 2.5\u00b0; in DZ, +5\u00b0 \u00b1 2.1\u00b0; in PAF, \u22125\u00b0 \u00b1 2.6\u00b0). Values in A1 fall significantly farther into the ipsilateral field than do those in DZ (p < 0.0004) or PAF (p < 0.0002), consistent with both the broader spatial tuning and less extreme azimuth centroids of A1 compared to PAF or DZ units [14,25]. Overall, the positioning of RAF slopes near the interaural midline suggests that auditory space is sampled inhomogeneously by the cortical population; the midline represents a transition region between locations eliciting responses from populations of contralateral- and ipsilateral-preferring units.\n\nFigure 3 RAF Slopes Are Steepest near the Interaural Midline\nPlotted are summaries of preferred locations (centroids) and points of maximum RAF slope for 254 units recorded in A1 (left), 411 in PAF (middle), and 298 in DZ (right) for levels 20 and 40 dB above threshold (thr) (bottom and top rows, respectively). In each panel, units are sorted by centroid (blue crosses) on the y-axis. Thin red lines denote the region of azimuth (x-axis) containing the centroid and bounded by the points of steepest slope. For units with centroids lateralized more than 10\u00b0 from the midline, we marked either the steepest positive slope (for ipsilaterally tuned units) or negative slope (for contralateral units) with a black circle. These points represent the location of most rapid response change that occurs toward the front of the animal (relative to the centroid; for units that respond throughout the frontal hemifield, this point can occur toward the rear). Distributions of centroid (blue line) and peak slope (black line), calculated using kernel density estimation with 20\u00b0 rectangular bins, are plotted below each panel. These indicate that while preferred locations (centroids) are strongly biased toward contralateral azimuths, peak slopes are tightly packed about the interaural midline, consistent with the opponent-channel hypothesis.\n\nNeural Response Patterns Discriminate Best across Midline\nModulation of spike count is generally the most salient location-sensitive feature of neural responses, especially when data are averaged over many trials. However, temporal features of the neural response\u2014such as first-spike latency, the temporal dispersion of spikes, and specific temporal features such as prototyped bursts of spikes or periods of inhibition\u2014could also play an important role in stimulus coding by cortical neurons, and we have studied this role using pattern-recognition analyses applied to spike patterns [12,14,35]. Here, we assess the ability of neural spike patterns to subserve pairwise discrimination of stimulus locations by adapting the pattern-recognition approach of Stecker et al. [14] to a discrimination paradigm. This approach is similar to the receiver-operating-characteristic analysis used to estimate interaural and/or spatial thresholds from neural spike counts [36,37,38], with the addition of spike-timing information. Given a spike pattern\u2014a smoothed, bootstrap-averaged peristimulus time histogram (2-ms bins) that approximates the instantaneous probability of spike firing over the course of 200 ms following stimulus onset\u2014elicited by stimulation from an unknown location in space, the algorithm estimates the relative likelihood that the pattern was evoked by a sound from each of the 18 tested locations. From these relative likelihoods, we compute the index of discriminability, d\u2032 [39], for each pair of stimulus locations. In Figure 4 (right), pairwise d\u2032 is plotted as a function of the midpoint and separation between paired stimuli for a single PAF unit; the contour d\u2032 = 1 (dashed line) indicates the spatial discrimination threshold. Note that in this example suprathreshold discrimination is possible at much narrower stimulus separations when the stimuli span the interaural midline (left/right discrimination) than in cases of front/back discrimination spanning +/\u2212 90\u00b0, about which point many features of the neural response (e.g., spike rate and latency) are symmetrical. As a result, the minimum discriminable angle (MDA, defined as the minimum separation along the d\u2032 = 1 contour) of 25\u00b0 is found at a best azimuth (BA, the midpoint location of the most discriminable pair) of \u22125\u00b0, near the frontal midline.\n\nFigure 4 Discrimination Analysis Based on Responses of One PAF Unit\nLeft: raster plot of spike times (x-axis) recorded in response to broadband noise stimuli varying in azimuth (y-axis). Note the strong modulation of spike count, response latency, and temporal features of the response between contralateral and ipsilateral locations.\n\nRight: pairwise spatial discrimination. Colors indicate d\u2032 values for pairs of stimulus locations varying in separation (y-axis) and overall azimuth (x-axis, midpoint of two azimuths). The dashed line indicates threshold discrimination (d\u2032 = 1), and the red circle marks the unit's MDA (y-axis) and BA (x-axis).\n\nIn Figure 5, MDA is plotted as a function of BA for the entire population of A1, PAF, and DZ units in which discrimination thresholds could be calculated. Overall, two main features of the results should be noted. First, despite the broad azimuth tuning of cortical neurons, the majority can discriminate between stimuli separated by less than 40\u00b0. A number of neurons successfully discriminate even smaller separations\u2014especially in DZ, in which the median MDA (30.5\u00b0 \u00b1 2.5\u00b0) is significantly smaller than in A1 (40\u00b0 \u00b1 2.6\u00b0; p < 0.007) or PAF (43\u00b0 \u00b1 3.8\u00b0; p < 0.0002). Note that MDAs of even the most sensitive units exceed behavioral estimates of 5\u00b0\u20136\u00b0 minimum audible angles in cats [40], but likely underestimate the true neuronal performance because loudspeaker separations were tested in minimum steps of 20\u00b0, and thus discrimination at smaller separations can only be assessed through extrapolation. Second, the distribution of BAs is tightly clustered around the interaural midline, with 50% of BA values falling within 18.5\u00b0 (PAF), 25\u00b0 (A1), or 26\u00b0 (DZ) of the 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 azimuth. Note that this does not mean that units cannot discriminate off-midline locations. It does indicate, however, that the majority of units capable of discriminating between stimulus azimuths do so best for location pairs near the interaural midline. Very few units exhibit BAs located far within either lateral hemifield, although A1 units exhibit significantly more ipsilateral BA values (median, +14.5\u00b0 \u00b1 3.9\u00b0) than those in PAF (0\u00b0 \u00b1 2.9\u00b0; p < 0.004) or DZ (5\u00b0 \u00b1 4.3\u00b0; p < 0.05). As with the analysis of RAF slopes, the pairwise discrimination data reveal an inhomogeneous arrangement of spatial sampling by neurons in the cortical population. Accurate discrimination is found where RAF slopes are steepest (the midline), rather than where units respond most strongly (the lateral poles).\n\nFigure 5 MDA by BA\nMDA (y-axis) is plotted against BA (x-axis) for each unit exhibiting suprathreshold spatial discrimination (see Materials and Methods). Symbols indicate the cortical area of each unit. Left and lower panels plot distributions of MDA and BA (in numbers of units per rectangular 20\u00b0 bin), respectively.\n\nAn Opponent-Channel Code for Auditory Space?\nWe have demonstrated quantitatively that the representation of auditory space in the cortex is inhomogeneous, consisting mainly of broadly tuned neurons whose responses change abruptly across the interaural midline. The population of auditory cortical neurons, then, appears to contain at least two subpopulations broadly responsive to contralateral and ipsilateral space. Neurons within each population exhibit similar spatial tuning and thus appear redundant with respect to spatial coding. The similarity of spatial tuning of units in these populations stands in contrast to their more profound differences in frequency tuning, for example. Each subpopulation, or \u201cspatial channel,\u201d is capable of representing locations on the slopes of their response areas (i.e., across the interaural midline) by graded changes in response\u2014a \u201crate code\u201d for azimuth, generalized to incorporate spatially informative temporal features of the cortical response [14,35,41]. In other words, each spatial channel encodes space more or less panoramically, as we have argued previously for individual cortical neurons [12], although it now seems clear that some regions of space are represented with greater precision than others. In the past, we have argued that auditory space is encoded by patterns of activation across populations of such panoramic neurons. Here, we amend that view\u2014which remains tenable\u2014to reflect the observed inhomogeneity of spatial sampling in the cortex and account for differences in coding accuracy of midline and other locations. Following the proposals of von B\u00e9k\u00e9sy [42] and van Bergeijk [43] regarding interaural coding in the brainstem, we propose that auditory space is encoded specifically by differences in the activity of two broad spatial channels corresponding to subpopulations of contralateral and ipsilateral units within each hemisphere (i.e., by a left/right opponent process). We will refer to this proposal as the opponent-channel theory of spatial coding in the auditory cortex.\n\nAn important consequence of the opponent-channel theory is that spatial coding may be robust in the face of changes in stimulus level. As is evident from past work, an important constraint on spatial coding in the cortex is the level dependence of many neurons' tuning widths, such that sharp tuning is seen predominantly for low-level stimulation. For example, a number of narrowly tuned units in Figure 3 exhibit locations of peak slope that closely track their centroids at 20 dB above threshold, and one could argue that such units form the basis of a local (e.g., topographic) spatial code when stimulus levels are low. Such a code, however, would be significantly impaired by increases in stimulus level\u2014predicting that sound localization should be most accurate at low levels. That prediction is not borne out in psychophysical tests [44,45], and we have argued that spatial coding in the auditory cortex must employ relatively level-invariant features of the neural response [12]. Rather than relying on such features as they naturally occur, the opponent-channel mechanism constructs level-invariant features by comparing the activity of neurons that respond similarly to changes in level but differentially to changes in location, similarly to the coding of color by opponent-process cells in the visual system [46].\n\nTo illustrate the level invariance achieved by opponent-process coding, we analyzed the ability of cortical population responses to signal sound-source locations in the frontal hemifield under different stimulus-level conditions. The analysis (see Materials and Methods) is simplified in a number of ways\u2014for example, it utilizes a simple linear decision rule that weights contralateral and ipsilateral input equally, sums across multiple neurons within each subpopulation (ignoring any complexity of neural circuitry), combines data across different cortical areas known to exhibit different spatial sensitivities, and reduces each neural response pattern to a single overall spike count\u2014but serves as a \u201cproof of concept\u201d that differences between the responses of neural subpopulations with quasi-independent spatial tuning can be used to estimate sound-source locations in an unbiased manner when stimulus levels vary, whereas the individual population responses cannot.\n\nPopulation responses (means of normalized spike rate across neurons in a population) to stimuli varying in location and level were computed separately for subpopulations composed of contralateral units or ipsilateral units in our sample of recordings in A1, PAF, and DZ. These subpopulations correspond to hypothetical \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d channels of a spatial coding mechanism. Classification of stimulus locations was based on either one of the subpopulation responses or the difference between the two, and involved linear matching to templates computed from a separate training set [14]. Population and difference RAFs are plotted in Figure 6 (left), along with confusion matrices (similar to Figure 2) for sound-source classification based on each (right). Relatively accurate classification is exhibited by both subpopulation responses and by their difference when test and training sets reflect the same stimulus level. When training and test sets differ, however, responses are systematically biased. After training with 20-dB stimuli, localization of 40-dB stimuli by the contralateral subpopulation is biased toward the contralateral hemifield, because 40-dB ipsilateral stimuli and 20-dB contralateral stimuli elicit similar responses. Similarly, when trained with 40-dB stimuli, localization of 20-dB stimuli is biased toward the ipsilateral hemifield. This pattern is clear in the responses of both the contralateral-preferring and ipsilateral-preferring subpopulations. Classification based on their difference, however, is relatively unbiased. Significant undershoot (central responses for peripheral stimulus locations) results from compression of population RAFs by intense sound. While we know of no behavioral data relating to the effects of stimulus level on sound localization by cats, undershoot has been reported in numerous studies of their localization behavior [47,48,49]. Such undershoots, however, need not be assumed to reflect a limitation of the underlying neural representation of auditory space.\n\nFigure 6 Difference between Channel Responses Is Less Sensitive to Changes in Level Than Are Channel Responses Themselves\nLeft: population responses (y-axis; see Materials and Methods) are plotted as a function of azimuth (x-axis) for stimuli presented 20 dB (red) and 40 dB (blue) above unit thresholds. Population responses were computed separately for subpopulations composed of contralateral units (top) or ipsilateral units (middle) corresponding to hypothetical \u201cleft\u201d and \u201cright\u201d channels of an opponent-channel spatial coding mechanism. The difference (bottom) between responses of the two subpopulations is more consistent across stimulus level than is either subpopulation response alone. Error bars indicate the standard deviation of responses across 120 simulated trials.\n\nRight: stimulus\u2013response matrices (confusion matrices; see Figure 2) showing the proportion (area of black circle) of responses to a given (unknown) stimulus azimuth (x-axis) classified at each response azimuth (y-axis). Classification assigned each neural population response in the \u201ctest\u201d set to the stimulus azimuth whose mean population response in an independently selected set of \u201ctraining\u201d trials was most similar. In some conditions, test and training trials were drawn from the same set of (matching level) trials: 20 dB (first column) or 40 dB (far right column). In others, test and training trials reflected different-level stimuli: 40-dB test stimuli classified based on a 20-dB training set (second column), or 20-dB test stimuli classified based on a 40-dB training set (third column). The contralateral and ipsilateral subpopulation responses (top and middle rows) accurately localize fixed-level stimuli, but are strongly biased when tested at non-trained stimulus levels. In contrast, the difference between responses (bottom row) remains relatively unbiased in all conditions, although responses to stimuli at untrained levels do exhibit compressed range and increased variability of classification.\n\nBased on its manner of level-invariant spatial coding, it seems clear that an opponent-channel mechanism should behave similarly in the presence of any stimulus change (e.g., in frequency, modulation, or bandwidth) that acts to increase or decrease the response of both channels. This suggests an efficient means for combining spatial information with information about other stimulus dimensions. This general principle of opponent-process coding should hold in any case where both channels exhibit similar sensitivity to the nuisance dimension (level, frequency, etc.) but dissimilar sensitivity to space, and illustrates one strength of the opponent-channel coding strategy: the ability to recover spatial information from the responses of neurons that are strongly modulated by other stimulus dimensions. As long as some of the cortical neurons involved in coding a particular acoustic feature are contralaterally driven and others are ipsilaterally driven, the spatial location of that feature can be computed without imposing additional distortion of its neural representation.\n\nNote that the opponent-channel theory as presented here involves contralateral and ipsilateral channels within each hemisphere. This feature is based on the observation of both types of neurons in a single hemisphere, and on the results of unilateral cortical lesions, which produce localization deficits mainly in contralesional space [2,30,31,50]. The lesion data prevent us from considering opponent-channel mechanisms that place each channel in a separate hemisphere (e.g., left-hemisphere contralateral units versus right-hemisphere contralateral units) because in that case unilateral lesions should abolish localization throughout the entire acoustic field. As proposed here, however, the opponent-channel mechanism in either hemisphere should be capable of coding locations throughout space, not just in the contralateral hemifield. This would suggest that only bilateral lesions could produce localization deficits, which is also not the case. At this point, we can merely speculate that auditory cortical structures in each hemisphere provide input only to those multimodal spatial or sensorimotor structures that subserve localization behavior in contralateral space and, furthermore, that these inputs cannot be modified in adulthood following cortical lesions.\n\nGeneral Discussion\nIn summary, the available data suggest that space is sampled nonuniformly in all fields of auditory cortex, with the majority of neurons responding broadly within one hemifield and modulating their responses abruptly across the interaural midline. Consistent with this view, we found cortical responses to be most sensitive to changes in stimulus azimuth at midline locations. Cortical neurons' RAFs tend to be steepest near the midline even though their preferred locations are found distributed throughout the contralateral hemifield. Spatial discrimination by neural responses is also best at or near the interaural midline. Results of both analyses are compatible with the existence of a limited number of spatial channels in the cortex, and incompatible with either a uniform distributed representation or a local representation (e.g., a topographic map). The relative paucity of units with sharp tuning peaking near the midline strongly suggests that behavioral sound-localization acuity is mediated by the slopes and not the peaks of spatial receptive fields.\n\nIn this report, we consider a model of spatial coding based on differences in the response rates of two broad spatial channels in the auditory cortex. It is similar to the mechanism proposed by Boehnke and Phillips [51] to account for differences in human gap detection when gaps are bounded by auditory stimuli occurring in the same or opposite hemifields. In each proposal, neural response rates are compared across channels, but each is also consistent with information encoded in the relative response timing of cortical neurons [25,52]. Although the psychophysical and physiological data seem to agree on a two-channel mechanism, it is important to note that in this study, we treat units that respond more strongly to forward than rearward locations (\u201caxial\u201d units) as equivalent to units that respond equally to both quadrants (\u201chemifield\u201d units). Similarly, we do not specifically examine the small number of units that respond best to midline locations. Distributed coding of interaural intensity by neural populations differing in binaural facilitation has been suggested previously [24]; similarly, populations of midline and/or axial units could be treated separately in a three-, four-, or five-channel opponent model of spatial coding. Such a model would follow the general principles of opponent-channel coding described here, but might differ in its ability to accurately code locations over wide regions of azimuth (see [24]).\n\nThat the representation of space appears inhomogeneous in both primary and higher-order auditory cortical fields argues against the existence of a topographic \u201cspace map\u201d within sensory cortex, pushing the emergence of any such map further into central structures than previously expected. The processing of interaural cues begins at the level of the superior olivary complex, but the integration of such cues into a complete topographic map of auditory space is presumed to begin with processing at the level of the IC or cortex. The suggestion that interaural cues are represented by a limited number of binaural channels in the IC [22] seems to imply that the space map must emerge at the level of auditory cortex or beyond, and the results of this study, along with others [15,16], suggest that a \u201climited channel\u201d code is maintained throughout primary and non-primary fields of the auditory cortex as well. PAF, in particular, appears to sit at the top of the auditory cortical processing hierarchy [53] but is similar to primary auditory cortex (A1) in this regard.\n\nWe should note that spatial coding must subserve at least two distinct behavioral tasks, namely, the discrimination of sound-source locations and the localization of individual sources (e.g., orientation, or pointing). Much of the current discussion has focused on aspects of spatial coding relevant to discrimination, and on the observation that the RAF slopes of cortical neurons are better suited to the discrimination of nearby locations than are their broad RAF peaks. Nevertheless, we are interested in general mechanisms of spatial representation, and argue that cortical neurons' broad spatial tuning suggests that neither aspect of sound localization is likely mediated by RAF peaks in cat cortex. This stands in contrast to the neural mechanism for sound localization in the IC of the owl, where sharp circumscribed spatial receptive fields form a place code for localization [7]. Owls' behavioral discrimination of spatial locations, however, is sharper than these neural receptive fields, and appears\u2014as in mammals\u2014to be mediated by receptive-field slopes [38]. Thus, the owl makes use of place and rate codes for different behavioral tasks. The cat's auditory cortex, on the other hand, lacks the sharp spatial tuning necessary for map-based localization, so one coding strategy underlies both types of behaviors.\n\nIt seems clear that these different coding strategies in owls and cats necessitate different mechanisms for generating motor responses and orienting to sound sources. The owl's space map exhibits a straightforward correspondence between restricted neural activity and locations in space, which might be ideal for computing audiovisual correspondence but requires further translation into motor coordinate systems before action can take place. It is possible that the opponent-channel code is transformed into a similar auditory space map within multisensory or sensorimotor areas, that is, not within auditory cortex itself. Alternatively, opponent-channel population codes in the auditory domain might be directly transformed into population codes in the motor domain without an intervening map-like representation. In either case, we could argue that the fundamental mode of spatial coding within the auditory system per se is non-topographic. In fact, it might be that auditory spatial topography is an emergent property of widespread neural populations and is evident only in perception and behavior, not in the physiology of single neurons.\n\nIn considering the relative advantages of opponent-channel spatial coding within the cortex, one might wonder whether the formation of a spatiotopic map would be necessary or desirable. As described above, the opponent-channel mechanism could subserve behavior without an intervening map, and it provides an efficient means of combining information about space with information about other stimulus features. In this regard, at least, the opponent-channel mechanism solves\u2014or simply avoids\u2014the so-called binding problem [54] of how multiple stimulus features can be associated to create a unified neural representation. It does so without recourse to specialized mechanisms for binding [55] and without an explosion in the number of neurons necessary for a complete combinatorial code [56]. So long as feature maps (e.g., of frequency) contain neurons of each class (i.e., contralateral and ipsilateral), the spatial position of any particular feature can be reconstructed without the difficulty of binding activity in one feature map (frequency) with that in another (location).\n\nFinally, the three cortical fields studied in this report exhibited similar evidence for an opponent-channel mechanism, despite previously reported differences in their spatial sensitivity [14]. Although such differences appear modest when assessed physiologically, studies indicate that some fields are more critical for localization behavior than others [30]. An intriguing question for future research involves cortical fields\u2014such as the anterior auditory field\u2014that are not necessary for accurate localization. Are spatial channels maintained in such fields, or are they combined to produce space-invariant representations of other stimulus features?\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nData analyzed for this report were collected from extracellular recordings of 254, 411, and 298 units in areas A1, PAF, and DZ (respectively) of the cortex of chloralose-anesthetized cats [14,25]. Methods of animal preparation, stimulus delivery, unit recording, and basic analysis have been described previously [14], and were approved by the University of Michigan Committee on Use and Care of Animals. Stimuli were delivered from loudspeakers placed in the free field, and consisted of 80-ms broadband noise bursts presented at levels 20\u201340 dB above unit threshold. Stimulus locations spanned 360\u00b0 of azimuth in 20\u00b0 steps, and are identified by angular distance from the frontal midline (0\u00b0). Positive azimuths increase to to the right (ipsilateral to the recording site), whereas negative values correspond to contralateral locations on the cat's left side. Unit activity was recorded extracellularly from the right cerebral hemisphere using 16-channel electrode arrays (\u201cMichigan probes\u201d), and spikes were sorted off-line based on principal-components analysis of their waveshapes.\n\nLocations of peak slope and centroids\nEach unit's preferred location was characterized by the azimuth centroid of response (dark blue crosses in Figure 3; see [14]); this is the spike-count-weighted average of contiguous stimulus locations eliciting a normalized response at or above 75% of maximum spike count per stimulus presentation. We additionally determined the locations of peak slope for each unit by smoothing its RAF (circular convolution with a 40\u00b0 boxcar) and calculating the first spatial derivative of the result. Maximum and minimum values of the derivative indicate two peak-slope azimuths for each unit (black circles and endpoints of red horizontal lines in Figure 3).\n\nSpatial discrimination by neural response patterns\nAnalyses of pairwise spatial discrimination (see Figures 4 and 5) employed a statistical pattern-recognition algorithm [14] to estimate the relative likelihood of each stimulus location, given the temporal pattern of neural response to a single (unknown) stimulus. We computed, for each pair of locations \u03b81 and \u03b82 in the loudspeaker array, the index of pairwise discriminability d\u2032 [39] based on the estimated relative likelihoods:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere z(P) represents scaling to the standard normal distribution and the probability P of responding \u201c1\u201d is given by the (estimated) relative likelihood l of location \u03b81 (versus \u03b82), conditional on the actual stimulus location \u03b8i.\n\n\n  \n\n\nThe analysis produces a map of d\u2032 between each pair of stimulus locations, plotted in coordinates of stimulus separation and overall location in Figure 4. The map was interpolated to find a contour of d\u2032 = 1, which we define as threshold discrimination. The smallest stimulus separation along the threshold contour defines the MDA, and the overall location of that stimulus pair defines the unit's BA. Symbols in Figures 4 and 5 indicate values of MDA and BA for individual units.\n\nEvaluation of a simple population code for space\nTo assess the level invariance of opponent-channel coding, we analyzed a simplified model of population spatial coding in the cortex. For each neural unit in a channel (e.g., a subpopulation of contralateral-preferring units), we accumulated a list of responses (spike counts normalized to the maximum response across all trials) on each trial with a given combination of stimulus azimuth and level. Azimuths were confined to the frontal hemifield (\u221280\u00b0 to +80\u00b0) to avoid front\u2013back confusions, which obscure but do not alter the appearance of bias in classification responses, and levels were either 20 or 40 dB above individual unit thresholds. We then computed population responses by randomly selecting one trial (with matching stimulus azimuth and level) from each unit and computing the mean of individual responses. We repeated the selection process 120 times for each combination of azimuth and level to simulate a set of 120 population \u201ctrials.\u201d The mean of these population responses for each stimulus is plotted on the left in Figure 6. Separate \u201ctraining\u201d and \u201ctest\u201d sets of population responses were computed by this method and used to assess the ability of subpopulations to classify stimulus locations. Individual population responses in the test set were classified to the azimuth with the most-similar mean population response across the training set. Confusion matrices in Figure 6 plot the proportion of test-set responses assigned to each stimulus azimuth. In some conditions, test and training sets were drawn from the same trials (matching level); in other conditions, training and test sets differed in stimulus level.\n\nWe tested classification based on responses of a contralateral subpopulation, an ipsilateral subpopulation, and on the difference between subpopulation responses. Contralateral and ipsilateral subpopulations were composed of all units with centroids falling farther than 30\u00b0 into the corresponding hemifield in our sample of A1, PAF, and DZ units. Differences were computed from the two subpopulation responses on a trial-by-trial basis, and classification was tested in the same manner as for the population responses themselves.\n\nStatistical procedures\nTests of statistical significance in this study were conducted using a 5,000-permutation bootstrap test (see [14] for details), reported to one significant digit. Standard error of the median, where reported, was obtained using a 2,000-permutation bootstrap, drawing N (the total number of data points) samples from the data with replacement on each permutation and recomputing the median. Distributions in Figures 3 and 5 were computed by kernel density estimation (convolution) with a 20\u00b0 rectangular window to obtain a continuous function of units per 20\u00b0 bin.\n\nWe thank Ewan Macpherson for assistance with data collection, Zekiye Onsan for technical and administrative support, and three anonymous reviewers for insightful comments.

The neural and functional mechanisms underlying this ability are still poorly understood. To investigate these mechanisms we used functional magnetic resonance imaging. Twenty-three subjects watched three kinds of stimuli: grasping hand actions without a context, context only (scenes containing objects), and grasping hand actions performed in two different contexts. In the latter condition the context suggested the intention associated with the grasping action (either drinking or cleaning). Actions embedded in contexts, compared with the other two conditions, yielded a significant signal increase in the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus and the adjacent sector of the ventral premotor cortex where hand actions are represented. Thus, premotor mirror neuron areas\u2014areas active during the execution and the observation of an action\u2014previously thought to be involved only in action recognition are actually also involved in understanding the intentions of others. To ascribe an intention is to infer a forthcoming new goal, and this is an operation that the motor system does automatically.\n\nFunctional magnetic resonance imaging is used to explore the responses of premotor cortical areas to observing the actions of others\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nThe ability to understand the intentions associated with the actions of others is a fundamental component of social behavior, and its deficit is typically associated with socially isolating mental diseases such as autism [1,2]. The neural mechanisms underlying this ability are poorly understood. Recently, the discovery of a special class of neurons in the primate premotor cortex has provided some clues with respect to such mechanisms. Mirror neurons are premotor neurons that fire when the monkey performs object-directed actions such as grasping, tearing, manipulating, holding, but also when the animal observes somebody else, either a conspecific or a human experimenter, performing the same class of actions [3,4,5]. In fact, even the sound of an action in the dark activates these neurons [6,7]. In the macaque, two major areas containing mirror neurons have been identified so far, area F5 in the inferior frontal cortex and area PF/PFG in the inferior parietal cortex [8]. Inferior frontal and posterior parietal human areas with mirror properties have also been described with different techniques in several labs [9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21].\n\nIt was proposed early on that mirror neurons may provide a neural mechanism for understanding the intentions of other people [22]. The basic properties of mirror neurons, however, could be interpreted more parsimoniously, such as that mirror neurons provide a mechanism for recognizing the observed motor acts (e.g., grasping, holding, bringing to the mouth). The mirror neuron mechanism is, in fact, reminiscent of categorical perception [23,24]. For example, some mirror neurons do not discriminate between stimuli of the same category (i.e., the sight of different kinds of grasping actions can activate the same neuron), but discriminate well between actions belonging to different categories, even when the observed actions share several visual features. These properties seem to indicate an action recognition mechanism (\u201cthat's a grasp\u201d) rather than an intention-coding mechanism.\n\nAction recognition, however, has a special status with respect to recognition, for instance, of objects or sounds. Action implies a goal and an agent. Consequently, action recognition implies the recognition of a goal, and, from another perspective, the understanding of the agent's intentions. John sees Mary grasping an apple. By seeing her hand moving toward the apple, he recognizes what she is doing (\u201cthat's a grasp\u201d), but also that she wants to grasp the apple, that is, her immediate, stimulus-linked \u201cintention,\u201d or goal.\n\nMore complex and interesting, however, is the problem of whether the mirror neuron system also plays a role in coding the global intention of the actor performing a given motor act. Mary is grasping an apple. Why is she grasping it? Does she want to eat it, or give it to her brother, or maybe throw it away? The aim of the present study is to investigate the neural basis of intention understanding in this sense and, more specifically, the role played by the human mirror neuron system in this type of intention understanding. The term \u201cintention\u201d will be always used in this specific sense, to indicate the \u201cwhy\u201d of an action.\n\nAn important clue for clarifying the intentions behind the actions of others is given by the context in which these actions are performed. The same action done in two different contexts acquires different meanings and may reflect two different intentions. Thus, what we aimed to investigate was whether the observation of the same grasping action, either embedded in contexts that cued the intention associated with the action or in the absence of a context cueing the observer, elicited the same or differential activity in mirror neuron areas for grasping in the human brain. If the mirror neuron system simply codes the type of observed action and its immediate goal, then the activity in mirror neuron areas should not be influenced by the presence or the absence of context. If, in contrast, the mirror neuron system codes the global intention associated with the observed action, then the presence of a context that cues the observer should modulate activity in mirror neuron areas. To test these competing hypotheses, we studied normal volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging, which allows in vivo monitoring of brain activity. We found that observing grasping actions embedded in contexts yielded greater activity in mirror neuron areas in the inferior frontal cortex than observing grasping actions in the absence of contexts or while observing contexts only. This suggests that the human mirror neuron system does not simply provide an action recognition mechanism, but also constitutes a neural system for coding the intentions of others.\n\nResults\nSubjects watched three different types of movie clips (see Figure 1): Context, Action, and Intention, interspersed with periods of blank screen (rest condition). The Context condition consisted of two scenes with three-dimensional objects (a teapot, a mug, cookies, a jar, etc). The objects were arranged either as just before having tea (the \u201cdrinking\u201d context) or as just after having tea (the \u201ccleaning\u201d context). The Action condition consisted of a hand grasping a cup in the absence of a context on an objectless background. Two types of grasping actions were shown in the same block an equal number of times: a precision grip (the fingers grasping the cup handle) and a whole-hand prehension (the hand grasping the cup body). In the Intention condition, the grasping actions (also precision grip and whole-hand prehension shown for an equal number of times) were embedded in the two scenes used in the Context condition, the \u201cdrinking\u201d context and the \u201ccleaning\u201d context (Figure 1). Here, the context cued the intention behind the action. The \u201cdrinking\u201d context suggested that the hand was grasping the cup to drink. The \u201ccleaning\u201d context suggested that the hand was grasping the cup to clean up. Thus, the Intention condition contained information that allowed the understanding of intention, whereas the Action and Context conditions did not (i.e., the Action condition was ambiguous, and the Context condition did not contain any action).\n\nFigure 1 Six Images Taken from the Context, Action, and Intention Clips\nThe images are organized in three columns and two rows. Each column corresponds to one of the experimental conditions. From left to right: Context, Action, and Intention. In the Context condition there were two types of clips, a \u201cbefore tea\u201d context (upper row) and an \u201cafter tea\u201d context (lower row). In the Action condition two types of grips were displayed an equal number of times, a whole-hand prehension (upper row) and a precision grip (lower row). In the Intention condition there were two types of contexts surrounding a grasping action. The \u201cbefore tea\u201d context suggested the intention of drinking (upper row), and the \u201cafter tea\u201d context suggested the intention of cleaning (lower row). Whole-hand prehension (displayed in the upper row of the Intention column) and precision grip (displayed in the lower row of the Intention column) were presented an equal number of times in the \u201cdrinking\u201d Intention clip and the \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention clip.\n\n\nFigure 2 displays the brain areas showing significant signal increase, indexing increased neural activity, for Action, Context, and Intention, compared to rest. As expected, given the complexity of the stimuli, large increases in neural activity were observed in occipital, posterior temporal, parietal, and frontal areas (especially robust in the premotor cortex) for observation of the Action and Intention conditions.\n\nFigure 2 Areas of Increased Signal for the Three Experimental Conditions\nThreshold of Z = 2.3 at voxel level and a cluster level corrected for the whole brain at p < 0.05.\n\nNotably, the observation of the Intention and of the Action clips compared to rest yielded significant signal increase in the parieto-frontal cortical circuit for grasping. This circuit is known to be active during the observation, imitation, and execution of finger movements (\u201cmirror neuron system\u201d) [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,25,26,27]. The observation of the Context clip compared to rest yielded signal increases in largely similar cortical areas, with the notable exceptions of the superior temporal sulcus (STS) region and inferior parietal lobule. The STS region is known to respond to biological motion [28,29], and the absence of the grasping action in the Context condition explains the lack of increased signal in the STS. The lack of increased signal in the inferior parietal lobule is also explained by the absence of an action in the Context condition. Note that, in monkeys, inferior parietal area PF/PFG contains mirror neurons for grasping [8]. Thus, it is likely that the human homologue of PF/PFG is activated by the sight of the grasping action in the Action and Intention conditions, but not in the Context condition, where the action is not presented. The Context condition activates the inferior frontal areas for grasping, even though only graspable objects\u2014but no grasping actions\u2014are shown. In the monkey brain, ventral premotor area F5 contains, in addition to mirror neurons, a population of cells called canonical neurons [4]. These neurons fire during the execution of grasping actions as well as during the passive observation of graspable objects, but not during the observation of an action directed at the graspable object. Neurons with these properties mediate the visuo-motor transformations required by object-directed actions [30,31] and are likely activated by the sight of the Context clips.\n\nThe critical question for this study was whether there are significant differences between the Intention condition and the Action and Context conditions in areas known to have mirror properties in the human brain. Figure 3 displays these differences. The Intention condition yielded significant signal increases\u2014compared to the Action condition\u2014in visual areas and in the right inferior frontal cortex, in the dorsal part of the pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (Figure 3, upper row). The increased activity in visual areas is expected, given the presence of objects in the Intention condition, but not in the Action condition. The increased right inferior frontal activity is located in a frontal area known to have mirror neuron properties, thus suggesting that this cortical area does not simply provide an action recognition mechanism (\u201cthat's a grasp\u201d) but rather it is critical for understanding the intentions behind others' actions.\n\nFigure 3 Signal Increases for Intention minus Action and Intention minus Context\nThreshold of Z = 2.3 at voxel level and a cluster level corrected for the whole brain at p < 0.05. The black arrow indicates the only area showing signal increase in both comparisons. The area is located in the dorsal sector of pars opercularis, where mirror activity has been repeatedly observed [10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,27]. See Tables S1 and S2 for coordinates of local maxima.\n\nTo further test the functional properties of the signal increase in inferior frontal cortex, we looked at signal changes in the Intention condition minus the Context condition (Figure 3, lower row). These signal increases were most likely due to grasping neurons located in the inferior parietal lobule, to neurons responding to biological motion in the posterior part of the STS region, and to motion-responsive neurons present in the MT/V5 complex. Most importantly, signal increase was also found in right frontal areas, including the same voxels\u2014as confirmed by masking procedures\u2014in inferior frontal cortex previously seen activated in the comparison of the Intention condition versus Action condition. Thus, the differential activation in inferior frontal cortex observed in the Intention condition versus Action condition, cannot be simply due to the presence of objects in the Intention clips, given that the Context clips also contain objects.\n\nFrom the contrasts Intention\u2013Action and Intention\u2013Context it is clear that the strongest activity in right inferior frontal cortex is present in the Intention condition. This could be due to two factors, not mutually exclusive: (1) a summation of canonical and mirror neurons activity, and (2) additional activation of mirror neurons of the inferior frontal cortex that code the action the agent will most likely make next. Because in the Intention clips the same action was shown in two contexts (\u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d), one can test the intention-coding hypothesis by analyzing the signal increase during observation of the Intention clips. A differential signal increase for the \u201cdrinking\u201d Intention clip compared to the \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention clip would indicate neural activity specifically coding the intention of the agent. This logic would hold only if there is no differential signal increase in the \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d Context conditions, when no action is displayed.\n\nTo test this hypothesis, we compared the signal change in the inferior frontal area in the two Intention clips and the two Context clips. The \u201cdrinking\u201d Intention clip yielded a much stronger response than the \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention clip (p < 0.003; Figure 4). In contrast, no reliable difference was observed between the \u201cdrinking\u201d Context clip and the \u201ccleaning\u201d Context clip (p > 0.19). These findings clearly show that coding intention activates a specific set of inferior frontal cortex neurons and that this activation cannot be attributed either to the grasping action (identical in both \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention clips) or to the surrounding objects, given that these objects produced identical signal increase in the \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d Context clips, when no action was displayed.\n\nFigure 4 Time Series of the Inferior Frontal Area Showing Increased Signal in the Comparisons Intention minus Action and Intention minus Context\nThe drinking Intention condition yielded a much stronger response than the cleaning Intention condition (p < 0.003), whereas no reliable difference was observed between the drinking and cleaning Context conditions (p > 0.19). The time series represents the average activity for all subjects in all voxels reaching statistical threshold in the right inferior frontal cortex.\n\nAutomaticity of the Human Mirror Neuron System\nWe also tested whether a top-down modulation of cognitive strategy may affect the neural systems critical to intention understanding. The 23 volunteers recruited for the experiment received two different kinds of instructions. Eleven participants were told to simply watch the movie clips (Implicit task). Twelve participants were told to attend to the displayed objects while watching the Context clips and to attend to the type of grip while watching the Action clips. These participants were also told to infer the intention of the grasping action according to the context in which the action occurred in the Intention clips (Explicit task). After the imaging experiment, participants were debriefed. All participants had clearly attended to the stimuli and could answer appropriately to questions regarding the movie clips. In particular, all participants associated the intention of drinking to the grasping action in the \u201cduring tea\u201d Intention clip, and the intention of cleaning up to the grasping action in the \u201cafter tea\u201d Intention clip, regardless of the type of instruction received.\n\nThe two groups of participants that received the two types of instructions had similar patterns of increased signal versus rest for Action, Context, and Intention (see Figures S1 and S2). The effect of task instructions is displayed in Figure 5. In all conditions, participants that received the Explicit instructions had signal increases in the left frontal lobe, and, in particular, in the mesial frontal and cingulate areas. This signal increase is likely due to the greater effort required by the Explicit instructions [32,33], rather than to understanding the intentions behind the observed actions. In fact, participants receiving either type of instructions understood the intentions associated with the grasping action equally well. Critically, the right inferior frontal cortex\u2014the grasping mirror neuron area that showed increased signal for Intention compared to Action and Context\u2014showed no differences between participants receiving Explicit instructions and those receiving Implicit instructions. This suggests that top-down influences are unlikely to modulate the activity of mirror neuron areas. This lack of top-down influences is a feature typical of automatic processing.\n\nFigure 5 Significant Signal Changes in Subjects Receiving Explicit Instructions Compared to Subjects Receiving Implicit Instructions in the Three Tasks Versus Rest\nThreshold of Z = 2.3 at voxel level and a cluster level corrected for the whole brain at p < 0.05. The two black arrows indicate two foci of activity in dorsal premotor cortex that are located deep in the sulci and thus not easily visible on the three-dimensional surface rendering. See Tables S3\u2013S5 for coordinates of local maxima.\n\nDiscussion\nThe data of the present study suggest that the role of the mirror neuron system in coding actions is more complex than previously shown and extends from action recognition to the coding of intentions. Experiments in monkeys demonstrated that frontal and parietal mirror neurons code the \u201cwhat\u201d of the observed action (e.g., \u201cthe hand grasps the cup\u201d) [4,6,8,34]. They did not address, however, the issue of whether these neurons, or a subset of them, also code the \u201cwhy\u201d of an action (e.g., \u201cthe hand grasps the cup in order to drink\u201d).\n\nThe findings of the present study showing increased activity of the right inferior frontal cortex for the Intention condition strongly suggest that this mirror neuron area actively participates in understanding the intentions behind the observed actions. If this area were only involved in action understanding (the \u201cwhat\u201d of an action), a similar response should have been observed in the inferior frontal cortex while observing grasping actions, regardless of whether a context surrounding the observed grasping action was present or not.\n\nBefore accepting this conclusion, however, there are some points that must be clarified. First, one might argue that the signal increase observed in the inferior frontal cortex was simply due to detecting an action in any context. That is, it is the complexity of observing an action embedded in a scene, and not the coding of the intention behind actions, that determined the signal increase. A second issue, closely related to the first one, is the issue of canonical neurons. These neurons fire at the sight of graspable objects. Because they are also located in the inferior frontal cortex, one might be led to conclude that the increased activity we observed in the Intention clips was due to the presence of objects. Note, however, that canonical neurons do not fire at the sight of an action directed to a graspable object, even though the object is visible [35].\n\nA strong argument against both these objections is that the activity in inferior frontal cortex is reliably different between \u201cdrinking\u201d Intention clips and \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention clips, even though graspable objects were present in both conditions. In contrast, no differences in activity in the inferior frontal region were observed when \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d clips of the Context condition were compared. Thus, the simple presence of an action embedded in a scene is not sufficient to explain the findings. Similarly, the sum of canonical and mirror neurons cannot account for the observed signal increase in the Intention condition, because this increase should be identical for both \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning.\u201d Because \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d contexts determined different activations in the Intention condition, it appears that there are sets of neurons in human inferior frontal cortex that specifically code the \u201cwhy\u201d of the action and respond differently to different intentions.\n\nAn important issue to consider in interpreting these data is the relationship between the present results and the activity of single neurons in the activated area. On the basis of our current knowledge of physiological properties of the inferior frontal cortex, the most parsimonious explanation of the findings reported here is that mirror neurons are the likely neurons driving the signal changes in our study. This proposal needs, however, a clarification.\n\nThe characteristic property of most mirror neurons is the congruence between their visual and motor properties. A neuron discharging during the execution of grasping also fires during observation of grasping done by another individual. This property cannot account for the present findings, specifically, the differences in response observed between the drinking and cleaning Intention clips. Our results suggest that a subset of mirror neurons in the inferior frontal cortex discharge in response to the motor acts that are most likely to follow the observed one. In other words, in the Intention condition, there is activation of classical mirror neurons, plus activation of another set of neurons coding other potential actions sequentially related to the observed one.\n\nThis interpretation of our findings implies that, in addition to the classically described mirror neurons that fire during the execution and observation of the same motor act (e.g., observed and executed grasping), there are neurons that are visually triggered by a given motor act (e.g., grasping observation), but discharge during the execution not of the same motor act, but of another act, functionally related to the observed act (e.g., bringing to the mouth). Neurons of this type have indeed been previously reported in F5 and referred to as \u201clogically related\u201d neurons [34]. In that previous study, however, the role of these \u201clogically related\u201d mirror neurons was never theoretically discussed and their functions remained unclear. The present findings not only allow one to attribute a functional role to these \u201clogically related\u201d mirror neurons, but also suggest that they may be part of a chain of neurons coding the intentions of other people's actions.\n\nWhat are the possible factors that selectively trigger these \u201clogically related\u201d mirror neurons? The most straightforward interpretation of our results is that the selection of these neurons is due to the observation of an action, also coded by classical mirror neurons, in a context in which that action is typically followed by a subsequent specific motor act. In other words, observing an action carried out in a specific context recalls the chain of motor acts that typically is carried out in that context to actively achieve a goal.\n\nAnother possible explanation of how mirror neurons are triggered can be related not only to the context, but also to the way in which the action is performed. It is more common to grasp the handle of the cup with a precision grip while drinking, and to use a whole-hand prehension while cleaning up. Thus, the grasp itself may convey information about the intention behind the grasping action. Although this consideration is very plausible, in general, there are reasons to believe that it is unlikely that this mechanism played a role in our study. First, in all presented grasping actions, when the handle was on the same side of the approaching hand, the grasp was always a precision grip, but when the handle was on the opposite side of the approaching hand, the grasp was always a whole-hand prehension. Thus, the hand always adopted the type of grasp afforded by the orientation of the cup, minimizing the impression that the type of grip would reflect the intentional state of the agent. Second, this hypothesis cannot explain the empirical data. In fact, in both drinking and cleaning Intention clips there was always the same number of precision grips and whole-hand prehensions. However, as Figure 4 shows, the drinking Intention entailed a much larger signal increase than the cleaning Intention. Thus, the differential brain responses in the two Intention clips cannot be explained by a possible meaning conveyed by the grasp type, and cannot even be explained by a possible \u201ccompatibility effect\u201d between grasp type and context type (for instance, a whole-hand prehension in a context suggesting cleaning).\n\nThe stronger activation of the inferior frontal cortex in the \u201cdrinking\u201d as compared to the \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention condition is consistent with our interpretation that a specific chain of neurons coding a probable sequence of motor acts underlies the coding of intention. There is no doubt that, of these two actions, drinking is not only more common and practiced, but also belongs to a more basic motor repertoire, while cleaning is culturally acquired. It is not surprising, therefore, that the chain of neurons coding the intention of drinking is more easily recruited and more widely represented in the inferior frontal cortex than the chain of neurons coding the intention of cleaning.\n\nThe conventional view on intention understanding is that the description of an action and the interpretation of the reason why that action is executed rely on largely different mechanisms. In contrast, the present data show that the intentions behind the actions of others can be recognized by the motor system using a mirror mechanism. Mirror neurons are thought to recognize the actions of others, by matching the observed action onto its motor counterpart coded by the same neurons. The present findings strongly suggest that coding the intention associated with the actions of others is based on the activation of a neuronal chain formed by mirror neurons coding the observed motor act and by \u201clogically related\u201d mirror neurons coding the motor acts that are most likely to follow the observed one, in a given context. To ascribe an intention is to infer a forthcoming new goal, and this is an operation that the motor system does automatically.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nParticipants\nThrough newspaper advertisements we recruited 23 right-handed participants, with a mean age of 26.3 \u00b1 6.3. Eleven participants (six females) received Implicit instructions while 12 participants (nine females) received Explicit instructions. Participants gave informed consent following the guidelines of the UCLA Institutional Review Board. Handedness was determined by a questionnaire adapted from the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory [36]. All participants were screened to rule out medication use, a history of neurological or psychiatric disorders, head trauma, substance abuse, and other serious medical conditions.\n\nImage acquisition\nImages were acquired using a GE 3.0T MRI scanner with an upgrade for echo-planar imaging (EPI) (Advanced NMR Systems, Woburn, Massachusetts, United States). A two-dimensional spin-echo image (TR = 4,000 ms, TE = 40 ms, 256 by 256, 4-mm thick, 1-mm spacing) was acquired in the sagittal plane to allow prescription of the slices to be obtained in the remaining sequences. This sequence also ensured the absence of structural abnormalities in the brain of the enrolled participants. For each participant, a high-resolution structural T2-weighted EPI volume (spin-echo, TR = 4,000 ms, TE 54 ms, 128 by 128, 26 slices, 4-mm thick, 1-mm spacing) was acquired coplanar with the functional scans. Four functional EPI scans (gradient-echo, TR = 4,000 ms, TE = 25 ms, flip angle = 90, 64 by 64, 26 slices, 4-mm thick, 1-mm spacing) were acquired, each for a duration of 4 min and 36 s. Each functional scan covered the whole brain and was composed of 69 brain volumes. The first three volumes were not included in the analyses owing to expected initial signal instability in the functional scans. The remaining 66 volumes corresponded to six 24-s rest periods (blank screen) and five 24-s task periods (video clips). In each scan there were two Context clips (during tea; after tea), one Action clip, and two Intention clips (drinking; cleaning) (see next section). The order of presentation of the clips was counterbalanced across scans and participants.\n\nStimuli and instructions\nThere were three different types of 24-s video clips (Context, Action, and Intention). There were two types of Context video clips. They both showed a scene with a series of three-dimensional objects (a teapot, a mug, cookies, a jar, etc). The objects were displayed either as just before having tea (\u201cdrinking\u201d context) or as just after having had tea (\u201ccleaning\u201d context). In the Action video clip, a hand was shown grasping a cup in absence of a context on an objectless background. The grasping action was either a precision grip (the hand grasping the cup handle) or a whole-hand prehension (the hand grasping the cup body). The two grips were intermixed in the Action clip. There were two types of Intention video clips. They presented the grasping action in the two Context conditions, the \u201cdrinking\u201d and the \u201ccleaning\u201d contexts. Precision grip and whole-hand prehension were intermixed in both \u201cdrinking\u201d and \u201ccleaning\u201d Intention clips. A total of eight grasping actions were shown during each Action clip and each Intention clip.\n\nThe participants receiving Implicit instructions were simply instructed to watch the clips. The participants receiving Explicit instructions were told to pay attention to the various objects displayed in the Context clips, to pay attention to the type of grip in the Action clip, and to try to figure out the intention motivating the grasping action in the Context clips. All participants were debriefed after the imaging session.\n\nData processing\nGE image files were converted in Analyze files and processed with FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Brain volumes within each fMRI run were motion corrected with Motion Correction using the Oxford Centre for Functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging of the Brain (FMRIB) Linear Image Registration Tool (MCFLIRT) [37]. Spatial smoothing was applied using a Gaussian-weighted kernel of 5 mm at full-width half-maximum, and data were high-pass filtered with sigma = 15.0 s and intensity normalized. Functional images were first registered to the co-planar high-resolution structural T2-weighted EPI volume after non-brain structures had been removed with FMRIB's Brain Extraction Tool (BET) from the co-planar high-resolution T2-weighted EPI volume [38]. The co-planar high-resolution structural T2-weighted EPI volume was subsequently registered to the Montreal Neurological Institute Talairach-compatible MR atlas averaging 152 normal subjects using FMRIB's Linear Image Registration Tool (FLIRT) [37].\n\nStatistical analyses\nData analyses were performed by modeling the three conditions (Context, Action, and Intention) as stimulus functions, applying the general linear model as implemented in FSL (http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl). Statistical analyses were carried out at three levels: an individual-run level; a higher-order, multiple-runs individual-subject level; and a further higher-order intra- and inter-group comparison level. Time-series statistical analyses were carried out using FMRIB's Improved Linear model (FILM) with local autocorrelation correction [39]. Higher-level intra- and inter-group statistics were carried out using mixed effect (random effects) implemented in FLAME (FMRIB's Local Analysis of Mixed Effects) [40]. Z image statistics were performed with a threshold of Z = 2.3 at voxel level and a cluster level corrected for the whole brain at p < 0.05 [41,42]. The signal change displayed in Figure 4 was statistically analyzed with repeated measures ANOVA and subsequent planned contrasts.\n\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Significant Signal Changes in Subjects Receiving Implicit Instructions for Each Task Versus Rest\nWith a threshold of Z = 2.3 at voxel level and a cluster level corrected for the whole brain at p < 0.05.\n\n(1 MB JPG).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Figure S2 Significant Signal Changes in Subjects Receiving Explicit Instructions for Each Task Versus Rest\nWith a threshold of Z = 2.3 at voxel level and a cluster level corrected for the whole brain at p < 0.05.\n\n(1.1 MB JPG).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Table S1 Intention minus Action\nLocal maxima in Talairach coordinates.

Peacocks strut around\n            with flashy feathers to attract mates, while peahens blend into their surroundings with\n            more subdued colors. But differences are not always as obvious or easily explainable as\n            in this classic example. Even the amount of genetic reshuffling that goes on during egg\n            and sperm production differs between males and females in most species. An evolutionary\n            reason for this has eluded researchers since the phenomenon was originally discovered in\n            fruitflies, Chinese silk worms, and amphipods almost 100 years ago.\n\nGenetic diversity among organisms is promoted when genetic information is rearranged\n            during meiosis, the cell division process that yields sperm and eggs (generically called\n            gametes). During this genetic reshuffling, chromosome pairs overlap, forming structures\n            called chiasmata (\u201ccrosses\u201d in Greek), and physically recombine. This\n            process does not just create diversity, it is also an example of\n            diversity\u2014recombination rates vary across chromosomes, sexes, and species.\n        \n\nMale and female recombination rates differ\nAn early 20th century hypothesis to explain the sex difference in recombination proposed\n            that recombination is restrained within a pair of unlike sex chromosomes (X and Y, for\n            example) and that the suppression spills over to the rest of the chromosomes. Under this\n            idea, the sex with dissimilar sex chromosomes (XY instead of XX, for example) should be\n            the one with the least amount of recombination in all chromosomes. But that is not\n            always the case. Some hermaphroditic species of flatworms, for example, lack sex\n            chromosomes altogether but still display marked differences in male and female\n            recombination rates. In one salamander genus, more reshuffling unexpectedly occurs in\n            the sex with two different sex chromosomes.\n\nIn a new study analyzing an updated dataset of 107 plants and animals, Thomas Lenormand\n            and Julien Dutheil bolster the argument against the recombination suppression hypothesis\n            by showing that in species with sex chromosomes, the sex with two dissimilar sex\n            chromosomes doesn't necessarily have a reduced recombination rate. Additionally, they\n            found that, as a trait, the sex difference in recombination rate is not a lot more\n            similar between two species in the same genus than between two species in different\n            genera, suggesting that the difference evolves quickly.\n\nAn alternative hypothesis suggests that sexual selection might play a role in\n            recombination differences. Reproductive success among males is often highly influenced\n            by selection, so mixing up successful genetic combinations in males could be\n            evolutionarily counterproductive. But in past studies, sexual selection was not related\n            to variation in recombination rates.\n\nPutting a new twist on this hypothesis, Lenormand and Dutheil realized that selection was\n            not necessarily limited to the adult stage and that differences in selection among eggs\n            or sperm might help account for recombination differences between the sexes. The authors\n            reasoned that more opportunity for selection on sperm than egg should correspond to less\n            recombination during sperm than egg production (and vice versa), consistent with the\n            idea that genetic combinations surviving selection should remain more intact in the sex\n            experiencing the strongest selection at the gametic stage.\n\nThough male gametes might be expected to be under stronger selection in many species, in\n            true pines it seems to be the female gametes. The ovules compete with each other for\n            resources over an entire year before being fertilized, and, indeed, from the dataset\n            analysis, ovule production involves low recombination rates compared with male pollen in\n            this group. In males, the opportunity for pollen competition was indirectly estimated\n            using self-fertilization rates. The authors assumed that pollen grains competing for\n            ovules of a self-fertilizing plant would be genetically similar and therefore experience\n            less selection. Again, in the analysis, low selection correlated with less recombination\n            in female gamete production, as predicted.\n\nIs selection among eggs and sperm the evolutionary force generating sex-based variation\n            in genetic shuffling? By demonstrating that differences may be influenced by gamete\n            selection in plants, this work has added clarity to otherwise contradictory\n            observations.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 1573698210.1371/journal.pbio.0030099SynopsisEcologyEvolutionGenetics/Genomics/Gene TherapyPlantsAnimalsSelection on Sex Cells Favors a Recombination Gender\n                    Gap Syn...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1044836.txt"}

For a barn owl, this boils down mostly to homing in on a field mouse scurrying in the night. For a human\u2014no longer faced with the reputedly fearsome saber-toothed Megantereon\u2014it might mean deciding whether to fear rapidly approaching footsteps from behind on a dark, desolate street.\n\nHow does the brain encode auditory space? The long-standing model, based on the work of Lloyd Jeffress, proposes that the brain creates a topographic map of sounds in space and that individual neurons are tuned to particular interaural time differences (difference in the time it takes for a sound to reach both ears). Another key aspect of this model is that the location of a sound source is encoded by the identity of responding neurons.\n\n\nDiscriminating sound locations from neural data\nEvidence for local coding of auditory space has been shown in the brains of owls and in a subcortical region of small mammals, but no such map has been found in the higher centers of the mammalian auditory cortex. What's more, electrophysiological recordings in mammals indicate that most neurons show the highest response to sounds emanating from the far left or right and that few neurons show that kind of response to sounds approaching head-on\u2014even though subjects are best at localizing sounds originating in front of them.\n\nFaced with such contrary evidence, other investigators have suggested that sound localization may rely on a different kind of code\u2014one based on the activity distributed over large populations of neurons. In a new study, Christopher Stecker, Ian Harrington, and John Middlebrooks find evidence to support such a population code. In their alternative model, groups of neurons that are broadly responsive to sounds from the left or right can still provide accurate information about sounds coming from a central location. Although such broadly tuned neurons, by definition, cannot individually encode locations with high precision, it is clear from the authors' model that the most accurate aural discrimination occurs where neuron activity changes abruptly, that is, at the midpoint between both ears\u2014a transition zone between neurons tuned to sounds coming from the left and those tuned to sounds coming from the right. These patterns of neuronal activity were found in the three areas of the cat auditory cortex that the authors studied.\n\nThese findings suggest that the auditory cortex has two spatial channels (the neuron subpopulations) tuned to different sound emanations and that their differential responses effect localization. Neurons within each subpopulation are found on each side of the brain. That sound localization emerges from this opponent-channel mechanism, Stecker et al. argue, allows the brain to identify where a sound is coming from even if the sound's level increases, because it is not the absolute response of a neuron (which also changes with loudness) that matters, but the difference of activity across neurons.\n\nHow this opponent-channel code allows an animal to orient itself to sound sources is unclear. However auditory cues translate to physical response, the authors argue that the fundamental encoding of auditory space in the cortex does not follow the topographic map model. How neurons contribute to solving other sound-related tasks also remains to be seen.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030103SynopsisNeuroscienceCatHow the Brain Signals a Sound Source Synopsis3 2005 22 2 2005 22 2 2005 3 3 e103Copyright: \u00a9 2005 Public Library of Science.2005This...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1044837.txt"}

This process begins even before the sperm and egg combine to form a zygote, because maternal factors are laid down in the egg that help establish the key axes of the body. After fertilization, precisely coordinated interactions between proteins called morphogens and a network of gene regulators establish a fly's anterior\u2013posterior axis and its pattern of segments in just three hours.\n\nIn a new study, Mark Isalan, Caroline Lemerle, and Luis Serrano simulated segmentation patterning by creating a synthetic embryo and engineering an artificial version of the gap gene network, the first patterning genes expressed in the zygote. This simple system, combined with computer simulations to test network parameters, identifies significant features of the complex embryo and could do the same for other complex biological systems.\n\n\nAn artificial network to study patterning in development\nOne of the first molecules to act is the Bicoid protein. This morphogen is present in a concentration gradient\u2014highest at the future head end. Different gap genes (so-called because their mutations create gaps in the segmentation pattern) respond to different levels of Bicoid, and are therefore switched on in different parts of the embryo. Expressed gap genes in turn modulate each other's activity. In the fruitfly, all of this action takes place while the embryo is a syncytium\u2014having many nuclei but no cell membranes to separate them.\n\nIsalan et al. created a model of segmentation patterning by using a tiny plastic chamber containing various purified genes, proteins, metabolites, and cell extracts to mimic the gap gene network. Some of the genes were attached to magnetic microbeads, so that their location could be controlled by magnets anchored to the bottom of the chamber.\n\nThe authors investigated a number of open questions about pattern formation, including how a morphogen diffusing from a local source generates an expression pattern along a gradient and how transcriptional repression sets pattern boundaries. After testing the system to mimic a simple network of sequential gene transcription and repression, the authors increased the components and connectivity of the network, starting with systems that had no repression interactions and moving on to systems that had different levels of cross-repression. Patterns generated by networks involving repression were much different from those generated by networks lacking repression, fitting with observations that patterning boundaries in living flies require cross-repression.\n\nBut even the unrepressed system generated reproducible patterns, possibly caused by simple competition between the proteins. While such a situation likely bears little resemblance to that inside a fly egg, the authors suggest that any such competition effects would have to be tested in flies. In any case, this simplified approach can test hypotheses of how simple networks might evolve inside a cell. And since many aspects of Drosophila embryonic patterning remain obscure, these synthetic chambers will provide a powerful resource for testing different hypotheses.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030104SynopsisBioinformatics/Computational BiologyDevelopmentSystems BiologyDrosophilaEngineering Gene Networks to Probe Embryonic Pattern Formation in Flies Syn...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1044838.txt"}

For the long-lived tubeworm Lamellibrachia luymesi, what it needs most and has least is sulfide. L. luymesi lives clustered around hydrocarbon-releasing ocean floor seeps in the Gulf of Mexico, and it\u2014or rather, its menagerie of internal bacterial symbionts\u2014uses the high-energy sulfide the way plants use sunlight, extracting energy and releasing the waste products, in this case sulfate.\n\nWith a lifespan of up to 250 years, L. luymesi is among the longest-lived of all animals, but how it obtains sufficient sulfide to keep going for this long has been a mystery. In this issue, Erik Cordes and colleagues propose a model in which, by releasing its waste sulfate not up into the ocean but down into the sediments, L. luymesi stimulates the growth of sulfide-producing microbes, and ensures its own long-term survival.\n\n\nAn aggregation of Lamellibrachia luymesi in the Gulf of Mexico (Photo: Ian MacDonald)\nThe sulfide L. luymesi needs is created by a consortium of bacteria and archaea that live in the sediments surrounding the vent. These chemoautotrophs use energy from hydrocarbons to reduce sulfate to sulfide, which L. luymesi absorbs through its unique \u201croots,\u201d extensions of its body that it tunnels into the sediments. Measurements of sulfide and sulfate fluxes in the water near the vents are inconsistent with the observed tubeworm colony size and individual longevity, leading Cordes et al. to propose that L. luymesi also uses its roots to release sulfate back to the microbial consortia from which it draws its sulfide.\n\nWithout this return of sulfate, the model predicts an average lifespan of only 39 years in a colony of 1,000 individuals; with it, survival increases to over 250 years, matching the longevity of actual living tubeworms. The model, which was based largely on empirical data, is relatively unperturbed by changes in hydrocarbon seep rate, or in the growth and recruitment rates for the colony. The authors note that the proposed return of sulfate into deep sediments would, in theory, increase the local rate of carbonate rock formation, creating a barrier to fluid circulation into the sediments. Their model predicts this to occur after about 50 years, in line with observed reductions in tubeworm recruitment in colonies of this age. They propose that carbonate precipitation may be inhibited if roots can also release hydrogen ions, a possibility open to further testing. Their model also explains several biogeochemical anomalies observed near tubeworm colonies, including elevated levels of highly degraded hydrocarbons and higher than predicted rates of sulfur cycling.\n\nTo date, the proposed return of sulfate to the sediments through the roots is only a hypothesis\u2014albeit one with much to support it\u2014that still awaits direct confirmation. By providing a model in which this hypothetical interaction provides real benefits and explains real observations, the authors hope to stimulate further research into the biology of L. luymesi.

It is believed mirror neurons increase an individual's ability to understand the behaviors of others, an important skill in social species such as humans. A critical aspect of understanding the behavior of another person is recognizing the intent of his actions\u2014is he coming to praise me or to bury me? In this issue, Marco Iacoboni and colleagues use functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to show that the mirror neuron system tracks not only the actions, but also the intentions, of others.\n\nThe researchers presented subjects with one of three types of movie clips, \u201ccontext,\u201d \u201caction,\u201d and \u201cintention.\u201d The \u201ccontext\u201d clip came in two versions. In the first, a mug of tea, a teapot, a pitcher of cream, and a plate of cookies sit neatly on a nondescript surface. In the second, the mug is empty, the pitcher is on its side, and a napkin lies crumpled beside scattered cookie crumbs\u2014the dregs of an apparently well-enjoyed snack. The \u201caction\u201d clip shows only an empty mug, being grasped either by the whole hand around the rim (called whole-hand prehension), or with the fingers on the handle (precision grip). The \u201cintention\u201d clip puts it all together, providing the context needed to understand the intent of the action. In the first context scene, the mug is grasped in the context of a well-laid spread, signaling intent to drink the tea. In the second, the mug is grasped against the backdrop of the rest of the tea-time dregs, signaling the intent to clean up. In both cases, the type of grasp used is alternated, to avoid implying intent merely based on grip type.\n\nThe essential interpretive technique in fMRI is to subtract the activation patterns from two different stimuli, thereby highlighting brain regions that are activated differentially in response to the difference in stimulus. In this study, \u201cintention minus context\u201d showed areas involved in recognizing both action and intention, while \u201cintention minus action\u201d showed areas for both context and intention. Comparing these two results, Iacoboni and colleagues found that an area in the right inferior frontal cortex, an area known to be involved in the mirror system, was activated only by scenes in which intention could be inferred. In the authors' words, \u201cit appears that there are sets of neurons in human inferior frontal cortex that specifically code the \u2018why\u2019 of the action and respond differently to different intentions.\u201d\n\nThey note that these neurons differ in function from previously defined mirror neurons in that they apparently code not current actions, but some aspect of future ones. In this interpretation, an action observed within a familiar context activates mirror neurons for \u201clogically related\u201d actions, those that most likely will follow the observed one. This suggests the mirror neuron system is intimately involved not only with understanding the behavior of others, but predicting it as well.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030109SynopsisNeuroscienceHomo (Human)Predicting the Future: Mirror Neurons Reflect the Intentions of Others Synopsis3 2005 22 2 2005 22 2 2005 3 3 e109Copyright...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1044840.txt"}

From this universal question come origin stories as diverse as the cultures who tell them. In some cases, little is known about a population's evolutionary history aside from these stories\u2014such is the case for the Mlabri people of Southeast Asia.\n\nUntil expanding agricultural development and modernization encroached on their forest homelands, the Mlabri lived mostly as nomadic hunter\u2013gatherers in the forests of northeastern Thailand and western Laos. This lifestyle is unique among the other so-called hill tribes of Thailand\u2014who all farm\u2014raising the possibility that the Mlabri descended from the ancient Hoabinhian hunting\u2013gathering culture of Southeast Asia and practice a way of life that predates agriculture.\n\n\nThe Mlabri of Thailand: Their history holds a lesson for anthropologists (Photo: Takafumi Ishida)\nScant historical information exists on Mlabri language, culture, and origin, but Mlabri traditions speak to a long history as hunter\u2013gatherers. The oral traditions of a neighboring hill tribe, the Tin Prai, paint a slightly different picture: several hundred years ago, legend has it, Tin Prai villagers sent two banished children downriver on a raft; the children, who survived by foraging in the forest, became the first Mlabri. In a new study, Mark Stoneking and colleagues use the tools of molecular anthropology to investigate the agricultural versus hunting\u2013gathering origin of the Mlabri and reveal a scenario remarkably similar to the traditional origin stories.\n\nThe notion that genetic analyses can shed light on this question, the authors explain, comes from a body of research indicating that hunting\u2013gathering groups have a lower level of genetic diversity and a higher frequency of unique mitochondrial (mtDNA) sequence types than neighboring agricultural groups. In this study, Stoneking and colleagues compared the genetic diversity of the Mlabri with that of six other agriculture-based hill tribes by analyzing specific regions of each population's mtDNA, Y chromosomes, and autosomes (non-sex chromosomes).\n\nmtDNA and Y chromosomes can help uncover clues to evolutionary origins because both are in effect haploid systems (i.e., there is only one copy of the Y chromosome and a lot of identical copies of mtDNA present in each cell), and so do not undergo recombination. This in turn means that observed genetic variations likely result from random mutation\u2014which is assumed to occur at a predictable rate\u2014allowing scientists to estimate the age of the genetic variation found in a population.\n\nThe mtDNA analysis revealed something remarkable: all the Mlabri mtDNA sequences were identical. Not only did all of the other hill tribes show \u201csignificantly higher\u201d variation, but this lack of variation hasn't been found in any other human population. The Y-chromosome and autosome analyses revealed the same reduced diversity, indicating a \u201csevere reduction in population size\u201d for the Mlabri. This reduction likely happened 500 to 800 years ago, Stoneking and colleagues conclude, and at most 1,000 years ago. But how? Since genetic analyses can't distinguish between a population bottleneck and a founding event, the authors used simulations to calculate the amount of population reduction required to completely eliminate mtDNA diversity, arriving at \u201cnot more than two unrelated females\u201d and \u201cperhaps even only one.\u201d\n\nBut were the first Mlabri farmers or hunter\u2013gatherers? Unlike other hunting\u2013gathering groups, the Mlabri share closely related mtDNA, autosomal, and Y-chromosome sequences with both the agriculture-practicing hill tribes and other agricultural groups in Southeast Asia. Linguistic studies suggest that the Mlabri language arose after speakers of a related language, probably Tin, split off and came into contact with another, as yet unknown language, an event that likely happened less than 1,000 years ago.\n\nThe genetic and linguistic evidence indicates that the Mlabri were \u201cfounded\u201d between 500 to 1,000 years ago by a single maternal lineage and one to four paternal lineages from an agricultural culture. With too few hands to farm, this tiny group likely turned to hunting and gathering. Altogether, Stoneking and colleagues conclude, these findings caution against automatically assuming that contemporary hunter\u2013gatherer groups \u201crepresent the pre-agricultural lifestyle of human populations, descended unchanged from the Stone Age.\u201d Interestingly, the authors' scenario of Mlabri origins is not so different from the story told by the Tin.\n\n", "abstract": "\n==== Front\nPLoS BiolPLoS BiolpbioplosbiolPLoS Biology1544-91731545-7885Public Library of Science San Francisco, USA 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030116SynopsisEcologyEvolutionGenetics/Genomics/Gene TherapyHomo (Human)An Evolutionary Road Less Traveled: From Farming to Hunting and Gathering Synopsis3 2005 ...", "authors": "Demo Data", "filename": "PMC1044841.txt"}

Position-effect variegation was used to stochastically perturb gene expression and probe nuclear reorganization. Variegating genes on rearrangements of Chromosomes X, 2, and 3 were probed for long-range interactions with heterochromatin. Studies were conducted only in tissues known to express the variegating genes. Nuclear structure was revealed by fluorescence in situ hybridization with probes to the variegating gene and heterochromatin. Gene expression was determined alternately by immunofluorescence against specific proteins and by eye pigment autofluorescence. This allowed cell-by-cell comparisons of nuclear architecture between cells in which the variegating gene was either expressed or silenced. Very strong correlations between heterochromatic association and silencing were found. Expressing cells showed a broad distribution of distances between variegating genes and their own centromeric heterochromatin, while silenced cells showed a very tight distribution centered around very short distances, consistent with interaction between the silenced genes and heterochromatin. Spatial and temporal analysis of interactions with heterochromatin indicated that variegating genes primarily associate with heterochromatin in cells that have exited the cell cycle. Differentiation was not a requirement for association, and no differences in association were observed between cell types. Thus, long-range interactions between distal chromosome regions and their own heterochromatin have functional consequences for the organism.\n\nThe authors have devised a way to compare the expression of a gene and its association with heterochromatin in a single cell - such association tightly correlates with gene silencing\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nFrom the broad level of the whole chromosome down to the individual gene, interphase chromosomes in every organism studied adhere to common organizational principles (reviewed in [1]). An aspect of chromosome structure important for organism function is long-range chromosomal interactions (LRCIs) between distant loci. LRCIs have been linked with gene silencing by insulators in Drosophila [2,3] and with Polycomb silencing of homeotic genes [4,5]. LRCIs between euchromatic loci and heterochromatin can silence genes (reviewed in [6,7]). LRCIs are not static, for example, the polar organization of Drosophila embryonic chromosomes changes as homologous loci pair and LRCIs within the nucleus form [8,9,10,11]. Mouse immune cells adopt unique contacts between silenced genes and heterochromatin during differentiation and cell fate specification [12,13,14]. These changes appear to be functional rather than merely structural, such that altering LRCIs appears to have profound biological consequences.\n\nLive studies of green-fluorescent-protein-tagged chromosomal loci reveal how LRCIs can change. Individual loci exhibit Brownian motion constrained to a defined volume, as observed in yeast [15,16,17], mammalian cells [15,18], and Drosophila [17,19]. Constraints are under developmental and cell cycle control, as evidenced by the observation that individual loci in male Drosophila pre-meiotic spermatocyte nuclei are more tightly confined in late G2 than in early G2 [19]. Relaxing constraints to allow considerable motion permits new LRCIs to form, while constraining loci more tightly can stabilize them. Developmental control of locus confinement could reconfigure a basic polar chromosomal organization into relatively stable developmental and cell-fate-specific architectures.\n\n\nDrosophila position-effect variegation (PEV) is an ideal system to study the functional consequences of altered LRCIs (reviewed in [20,21]). PEV occurs when chromosome rearrangements juxtapose euchromatic genes and heterochromatin, producing a variegated expression pattern such that the gene is silenced in some but not all cells. These rearrangements also cause the affected genes to form long-range interactions with heterochromatin in a subset of cells [9,22]. Genetic evidence suggests that PEV may utilize these long-range interactions to silence genes. PEV can skip over one gene to silence another [23] or silence a wild-type locus on a homologous chromosome [9,22,24]. In the case of bwD variegation, chromosome rearrangements that alleviate PEV move the affected gene farther away from heterochromatin, while rearrangements that move the locus closer to heterochromatin enhance PEV [25,26]. This suggests that juxtaposition between a gene and heterochromatin allows for gene-to-heterochromatin interactions that can cause silencing. Once formed, these contacts may cause a gene to be silenced either by repackaging the gene into heterochromatin or by a specific silencing activity sequestered within heterochromatin itself.\n\nInteraction with heterochromatin does seem to correlate with the silencing of specific genes, but the connection between association with heterochromatin and silencing has not been directly verified. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques to identify chromosomal and heterochromatic loci are not generally compatible with the detection of gene expression. Furthermore, studies that have examined the connection between LRCIs and silencing by modulating the amount of PEV-induced repression have given conflicting results: one study found a correlation between relaxed silencing and relaxed association [22], whereas another did not [24]. Because the affected gene's expression was not compared to its association with heterochromatin on a cell-by-cell basis, it remains unclear whether, in a given cell, a heterochromatin-associated locus was silenced or expressed.\n\nFor the first time, to our knowledge, we present an experimental system that compares the expression of a variegating gene and its association with heterochromatin on a cell-by-cell basis for three different variegating genes in Drosophila whole-mount tissues. Multiple lines were chosen to ensure that results could be generally applied to PEV, rather than being limited to a specific rearrangement. The positions of variegating chromosomal loci and regions of heterochromatin were probed by FISH while fluorescent detection of eye pigments or variegating gene proteins marked gene expression. The affected gene in each line is quite far (>10 MB) from the centromere, with a block of heterochromatin placed nearby either through insertion or inversion. This provided an easy assay for long-range interactions with centromeric heterochromatin, as an interacting gene would relocate a significant distance across the nucleus to interact with centromeric regions. The variegating genes used are expressed in the Drosophila eye or eye imaginal disk; therefore, our examinations were limited to these tissues. Cell types, developmental stages, and cell cycle states were identified to determine what effects these variables might have on LRCIs with heterochromatin.\n\nOur results show that interactions between variegating loci and heterochromatin are tightly correlated with gene silencing. Cells in which the variegating gene has been silenced exhibit a tight distribution of distances, suggesting direct interaction between heterochromatin and the distally located gene. Expressing cells, however, show a much broader distribution, with far fewer interactions between variegating loci and heterochromatin. Furthermore, these interactions with heterochromatin are primarily found in non-dividing cells in the eye disk. Differentiation is not required for LRCIs to occur, and interactions did not differ between cell types.\n\nResults\nLRCIs Are Strongly Correlated with Gene Silencing\nUsing gene expression as a functional assay, the consequences of LRCIs between chromosomal loci and heterochromatin were probed on a cell-by-cell basis. The first variegating gene examined was the brown gene on the bwD rearrangement. Expression of brown RNA has only been detected in recently eclosed adult heads; therefore, gene expression experiments were confined to this tissue [27]. Our experiments were greatly simplified by working in a scarlet background as in [26] as this eliminated the brown pigments from the eye. Therefore brown-expressing cells contained red pteridine pigment while non-expressors contained none (Figure 1).\n\nFigure 1 Gene Expression and LRCIs\nColor images show combined FISH\u2013gene expression results for each of the three lines studied.\n\n(A and B) bwD adult eye tissue. brown-expressing cells with pigment are blue, DAPI is red, single-copy FISH marking the brown locus is white, and heterochromatic single is green.

The distribution of distances from expressing cells was broad, centered around 1 \u03bcm and extending to about 2 \u03bcm (Figure 2A). Looking at the cumulative percentage plots, few nuclei (10%) had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances shorter than 0.5\u03bcm, and barely 25% had distances shorter than 0.75 \u03bcm (Figure 2G, blue line). Silenced cells, however, had a tight distribution of distances centered around 0.5 \u03bcm, with virtually all variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances being under 1 \u03bcm (Figure 2D). Cumulative percentage plots show nearly 40% of distances were shorter than 0.5 \u03bcm, and nearly 80% of nuclei had distances shorter than 0.75 \u03bcm (Figure 2G, red line). The Mann\u2013Whitney U test revealed that these differences were highly significant. (p < 0.0001; Table 1).\n\nFigure 2 Silenced Genes Associate Tightly with Heterochromatin\nPhysical distances in microns between heterochromatic sequences near each chromosome's centromere and the variegating gene were measured and sorted based on expressing or non-expressing cells.\n\n(A\u2013C) Expressing cells.\n\n(D\u2013F) Silenced cells.\n\n(G\u2013I) percentile plots of (A\u2013F), in which blue represents expressing cells, red represents silenced cells, and green represents wild-type nuclei. bwD nuclei are Su(bwD)208 cells in adult eyes; In(1)rst3 and In(3L)BL1 data are from imaginal eye disks.\n\nTable 1 Summary of Reported Results\nThe second variegating gene examined was the white gene in the In(1)rst3. Antisera developed against the unique N-terminus of the White protein (see Figure S1 and part 1 of Protocol S1) stained white-expressing cells in In(1)rst3 disks as expected from their eye pigmentation (Figure 1E and 1F). LRCIs between white and the 1.688 satellite correlated strongly with PEV-mediated silencing of white (Figure 2B, 2E, and 2H). As before, cells expressing the variegating gene had a broad distribution of distances, in this case centered at 1.5 \u03bcm and continuing to 4 \u03bcm (Figure 2B). Cumulative percentage plots reveal that only 20% of nuclei expressing white had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances under 1 \u03bcm (Figure 2H, blue line). The distance distribution for silenced cells was much narrower than that for expressing cells, with distances centered around 0.8 \u03bcm and extending to only 2 \u03bcm in total distance (Figure 2E). Cumulative percentage plots show that over 60% of nuclei from silenced cells had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances of under 1 \u03bcm (Figure 2H, red line) compared to 20% for expressing cells. Differences between expressing and silenced populations of cells were highly significant (p < 0.0001; Table 1). Despite the marked differences in association levels between expressing and silenced cells, the distributions of distances overlapped considerably between expressing and non-expressing cells (Figure 2B and 2E).\n\nThe third variegating gene examined was the heat-shock inducible beta-galacosidase transgene located on the In(3L)BL1 rearrangement. The expression of beta-galactosidase in In(3L)BL1 showed no preference for cell type, and was only found behind the morphogenic furrow (Figure 1C and 1D) [28,29]. In(3L)BL1 nuclei showed patterns of interaction and expression similar to those seen in the brown and white variegating lines. Expressing cells showed a broad distance distribution centered around 1.5 \u03bcm and extending out to nearly 4 \u03bcm (Figure 2C). Cumulative percentage plots show barely 15% of expressing cells had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances 1 \u03bcm or less (Figure 2I, blue line).\n\nIn(3L)BL1 silenced nuclei displayed a rather narrow distribution, with a median distance of under 1 \u03bcm (Figure 2F). As in In(1)rst3 disks, cumulative percentage plots also showed more than 60% of silenced nuclei had distances between the silenced gene and heterochromatin under 1 \u03bcm (Figure 2I, red line). The narrow distribution of distances meant that silenced nuclei rarely had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances greater than 2 \u03bcm, while expressing cells had greater distances in at least 50% of cells. Also similar to In(1)rst3, variegating genes in silenced cells were not 100% associated with heterochromatin (Figure 2C and 2F), with 40% of silenced nuclei having variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances greater than 1 \u03bcm. Additionally, some expressing cells had variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances less than 1 \u03bcm, in this case roughly 10%.\n\nInteraction between Variegating Genes and Heterochromatin Primarily Occurs in Non-Dividing Cells\nWhile it was clear that silencing of a variegating gene was tightly correlated with its interaction with heterochromatin, it was not known what other factors might affect this interaction. A study of how cell cycle progression and differentiation might affect interactions between a variegating gene and heterochromatin was undertaken. The cell cycle had previously been implicated as a force that periodically disrupts LRCIs [9,30]. The third-instar eye imaginal disk is an excellent tissue to explore this possibility because it contains well-separated populations of dividing and non-dividing cells. The anterior portion of the eye imaginal disk contains dividing cells (Figure 3A [left of dotted line] and 3B). The morphogenic furrow contains cells arrested in G1. Posterior to the morphogenic furrow, many cells cease dividing and differentiate (Figure 3A [right of dotted line] and 3C). Because of our sample preservation methods (see Materials and Methods), it was also possible to distinguish each individual photoreceptor cell and cone cell by their unique three-dimensional position and nuclear shape (Figure 3D; [31]). Our results therefore contain three groups of nuclei: nuclei from dividing cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow and differentiated cone cell nuclei and photoreceptor cell nuclei from behind the morphogenic furrow.\n\nFigure 3 Preservation of Tissue Architecture and Cell-by-Cell Identification in the Drosophila Eye Disk\n\nbwD eye disks were processed for FISH and stained for nuclear lamin as described in Materials and Methods.

Apical cells are at the top, basal at the bottom.\n\n\nbwD\n\nLRCIs were dramatically different between dividing and non-dividing cells in bwD disks (Figure 4). Cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow (Figure 4A) had a roughly Gaussian distribution of distances. The cumulative percentage plots show that few nuclei had less than 1 \u03bcm distance between the variegating gene and heterochromatin (<10%) (Figure 4J, red line).\n\nFigure 4 Association Primarily Occurs in Non-Dividing Cells\nPhysical distances in microns between heterochromatic probe signals and P1 probe signals were measured for each line and sorted based upon their position relative to the morphogenic furrow and cell fate.\n\n(A\u2013C) Cells anterior to morphogenic furrow.\n\n(D\u2013F) Differentiated cone cells behind the morphogenic furrow.\n\n(G\u2013I) Differentiated photoreceptor cells behind the morphogenic furrow.\n\n(J\u2013L) Percentile plots for histograms in (A\u2013I). Blue, wild-type cells; red, anterior cells; green, cone cells; pink, photoreceptor cells.\n\nEntirely different results were found for cone and photoreceptor cells behind the morphogenic furrow. The distributions in both cases were substantially skewed, with a long tail of distances representing cells in which brown was greater than 1 \u03bcm from heterochromatin (Figure 4D and 4G). Cumulative percentage plots reveal that interactions were far more common in differentiated cells behind the morphogenic furrow than in the dividing anterior cells (Figure 4J, purple and green lines). The majority of nuclei in both cone cells and photoreceptor cells had their variegating gene closer than 1 \u03bcm to the centromeric heterochromatin on 2R. Statistical tests showed that the distributions of cone cells and photoreceptor cells were significantly different from dividing anterior cells (p < 0.0001; Table 1) but were not significantly different from one another (p = 0.15). This argues that differences between cell types do not have a significant effect upon brown-to-centeromeric-heterochromatin LRCIs. Cone cells and photoreceptor cells are also different in shape and nuclear volume. The fact that no difference in heterochromatic association was found suggests that in these cell types nuclear shape and volume do not play a meaningful role in LRCIs with heterochromatin.\n\nIn(1)rst3\n\nThe inverted X chromosome In(1)rst3 displayed similar results to that of bwD. Gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions in anterior cells were nearly Gaussian (Figure 4B), such that few nuclei had variegating genes closer than 1 \u03bcm to the centromeric heterochromatin (<10%; Figure 4K, red line). Nuclei posterior to the morphogenic furrow displayed a skewed distribution similar to bwD (Figure 4E and 4H). Cone cells and photoreceptor cells displayed nearly identical distributions and were not statistically distinct (p = 0.0319). These distributions are markedly different from those of anterior cells (Figure 4B), with most nuclei exhibiting a shorter variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distance (Figure 4E and 4H). The cumulative percentage plots confirm this (Figure 4K, purple and green lines), in that posterior cells routinely showed association levels 40% higher than anterior cells.\n\nIn(3L)BL1\nThe line In(3L)BL1 was a notable exception to previous results as it had an almost bimodal distribution of distances in cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow (Figure 4C). The cumulative percentage plots show dividing nuclei with variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances less than 1 \u03bcm (25%; Figure 4L, red line). This may be due to confounding effects of the multiply inverted balancer TM3. Gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions from differentiated cells were not substantially skewed towards shorter distances relative to anterior cells (Figure 4F and 4I). There were few noticeable differences, as shown in cumulative percentage plots (Figure 4L, purple and green lines relative to blue). These differences were not statistically significant between cone and anterior cells (p = 0.0567; see Table 1) nor between photoreceptor and anterior cells (p = 0.6600; Table 1). Distributions from cone and photoreceptor cells were not significantly different (p = 0.0184; Table 1; Figure 4F and 4I), nor were there any noticeable differences between the cell types in the cumulative percentage plots (Figure 4L, purple and green lines).\n\nData from each variegating locus were compared with the behavior of loci on wild-type chromosomes; variegating loci behaved quite differently from those on wild-type chromosomes (see Table S1 and part 2 of Protocol S1).\n\nDifferentiation Is Not Necessary for Association\nBecause LRCIs were found in differentiated nuclei, this suggested that differentiation was important for interaction with heterochromatin. Alternatively, cessation of the cell cycle may allow loci to interact with heterochromatin because the periodic anaphases are eliminated [9]. The unique cell cycle profile of the eye imaginal disk presented an elegant way to distinguish between these two possibilities. Eye disk cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow divide in a band (I in Figure 5A and 5B) and arrest in the furrow at G1, as cartooned in Figure 5A and 5B. Posterior to the furrow, cells either differentiate into ommatidia or replicate their DNA. Some cells in this undifferentiated pool divide in the second mitotic wave (II in Figure 5A and 5B) and differentiate immediately. The remaining cells pause in G2 and await a signal to divide [32]. These G2-arrested cells behind the morphogenic furrow have been in interphase since the first mitotic wave ([32]; Figure 5A, shaded nuclei). If interaction requires differentiation, these G2-arrested cells should show less association than differentiated cells. If these G2 cells show equivalent levels of association, then a sufficiently long cell cycle permits variegating genes to interact with heterochromatin. G2 cells are easy to identify in third-instar eye disks as their nuclei react to anti\u2013cyclin A antisera and are basal to differentiated and dividing nuclei (Figure 5D and 5E; [33,34]). G1-arrested cells are also clearly identified as a band of unstained nuclei between the anterior and posterior portions of the eye disk (Figure 5C).\n\nFigure 5 Identification of Cell Cycle Stages in Drosophila Eye Disks\nA combination of immunofluorescence to cyclins and tissue architecture was used to identify cells in specific cell cycle states.\n\n(A) Cartoon of eye disk that shows populations of dividing and cell-cycle-arrested cells. I, first mitotic wave; II, second mitotic wave. G2-arrested cells are filled nuclei located basally posterior to the furrow.\n\n(B) Cartoon of same disk viewed from above apical side of disk. Anterior is to the left.\n\n(C\u2013E) Immunofluorescence against G2 cyclins identifies cells in G1 and G2 arrest. Red is anti\u2013cyclin A, green is single-copy FISH signal, and blue is heterochromatic FISH signal. (C) G1-arrested cells can be identified as those near and in the morphogenic furrow that do not show G2 cyclin staining. (D) G2-arrested cells posterior to the morphogenic furrow show dense anti\u2013cyclin A staining. (E) Close-up of cells shown in (D).\n\nG2-arrested cells in the bwD line showed variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distances similar to those of differentiated cells (Figure 6). As in differentiated cells, the majority of G2-arrested nuclei had distances between the variegating gene and heterochromatin less than 1 \u03bcm. As shown in the cumulative percentage plots, G2-arrested nuclei were nearly indistinguishable from differentiated nuclei (Figure 6M, yellow and purple lines). These two distributions were also similar by statistical tests (p > 0.2; Table 1). Similar results were seen with In(1)rst3 and In(3L)BL1 G2-arrested nuclei, such that the gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions in arrested nuclei were indistinguishable from those of differentiated cells (Figure 4H and 4I compared to Figure 6K and 6L). Cumulative percentage plots likewise do not show any differences between arrested nuclei and differentiated ones (Figure 6N and 6O), and these distributions were not statistically distinct (p > 0.1; Table 1).\n\nFigure 6 Differentiation Is Not Required for Association\nPhysical distances in microns between heterochromatic probe signals and P1 probe signals were measured for each line and sorted based upon staining for G2 cyclins.\n\n(A\u2013C) Cells anterior to morphogenic furrow.\n\n(D\u2013F) G1-arrested cells (in furrow, no cyclin staining).\n\n(G\u2013I) G2-arrested cells, basal and stained for cyclins.\n\n(J\u2013L) Differentiated cells behind the morphogenic furrow.\n\n(M\u2013O) Percentile plots for (A\u2013L). Blue, wild-type cells; red, anterior cells; green, G1-arrested cells; pink, G2-arrested cells; yellow, differentiated cells.\n\n\nbw-to-heterochromatin distances in bwD G1-arrested nuclei displayed a bimodal distribution (Figure 6D), unlike the unimodal distributions seen for anterior cells (Figure 6A) and differentiated cells (Figure 4J). One peak shows a distance distribution similar to that seen for G2-arrested and differentiated cells (Figure 6G and 6J), while a second is intermediate between that of differentiated and anterior nuclei. Cumulative percentage plots show a marked difference between G1-arrested nuclei and all other populations, including an inflection in the curve between the two peaks in the G1 distribution (Figure 6M, red line). It appears that the morphogenic furrow is a transition state, whereby variegating genes that were once quite far from heterochromatin (Figure 6A) begin to associate with centromeric regions on the same chromosome. Similar behavior is also seen in In(1)rst3 and In(3L)BL1 nuclei (Figure 6E and 6F). Distributions in these two lines are not bimodal, but they are intermediate between anterior and differentiated nuclear distributions. Cumulative percentage plots also show distinctions between these nuclei and the other populations (Figure 6N and 6O, red lines). Statistical tests showed that all three distributions of G1 nuclei were distinct from anterior cells (p < 0.0001; Table 1), but that only bwD G1 nuclei were different from differentiated cells (p < 0.0001; Table 1).\n\nVariegating Genes Associate with Heterochromatin at Their Own and Other Centromeres\nAn appreciable percentage of loci were found far from centromeric cis-heterochromatin, even in PEV-silenced nuclei. These silenced yet far loci may form LRCIs with heterochromatin on other chromosomes (trans-heterochromatin). While other authors found that variegating rearrangements involving bw preferentially associated with cis-heterochromatin [9,35], we felt this issue merited reexamination. In two sets of experiments per line, probes marking variegating loci were compared with two different heterochromatic probes: one marked cis-heterochromatin while another identified trans-heterochromatin. Each variegating gene was examined for promiscuous interaction with centromeric heterochromatin on each large chromosome. Data were sorted based on whether the variegating gene was within 1 \u03bcm of heterochromatin on its own chromosome (Figure 7A), on a different chromosome (Figure 7B), or on both chromosomes (Figure 7C).\n\nFigure 7 Interaction of Variegating Genes with Heterochromatin on Other Chromosomes\nAll three lines were examined to see how often variegating genes interacted with heterochromatin on their own and other chromosomes.\n\n(A) Close-up of In(1)rst3 nucleus showing variegating gene interaction with heterochromatin on its own chromosome.\n\n(B) Close-up of In(1)rst3 nucleus showing variegating gene interaction with heterochromatin on a different chromosome.\n\n(C) In(1)rst3 nucleus showing variegating gene interaction with heterochromatin on both its own and another chromosome.\n\n(D\u2013F) Bar plots of interaction frequencies of variegating genes with their own heterochromatin and that found on other chromosomes. A distance of 1.0 \u03bcm was chosen as the maximum distance for interaction to occur.\n\nAs in Dernburg et al. [9], the brown locus on the bwD chromosome interacted primarily with heterochromatin on the same chromosome (Figure 7D). Interactions with trans-heterochromatin on Chromosomes X and 3 where the brown gene was not associating with cis-heterochromatin were generally limited to 5%\u201310% of examined nuclei. Interactions where the brown gene was close to heterochromatin on multiple chromosomes were also infrequent, between 2%\u20135% of examined nuclei.\n\nThe In(3L)BL1 chromosome differed from the bwD chromosome in that comparable levels of association were observed between cis- and trans-heterochromatin (Figure 7E). The In(3L)BL1 chromosome's transgene interacted similarly with heterochromatin on Chromosomes 2 and 3 (20% of nuclei examined), but only 10% with the X chromosome. Interactions of the variegating gene with heterochromatin on multiple chromosomes were less common, at around 5%\u201310% of nuclei examined. The variegating locus on In(3L)BL1 seemed to show a preference for associating either with heterochromatin on its own chromosome or that of Chromosome 2.\n\nThe In(1)rst3 line showed similar levels of association with heterochromatic blocks on all three chromosomes, with around 10% of nuclei exhibiting distances less than 1 \u03bcm (Figure 7F). Unlike in the other lines examined, the variegating gene was rarely close to heterochromatin on multiple chromosomes, suggesting that the white locus interacts with only one block of heterochromatin at a time.\n\nWhile the bwD chromosome exhibited a marked preference for associating with heterochromatin on its own chromosome, the other two lines did not. This suggests that the tails of the distances seen in the silenced cells of In(1)rst3 and In(3L)BL1 could well be explained by interaction with heterochromatin on other chromosomes. bwD's infrequent association with blocks of heterochromatin on other chromosomes may explain the smaller tails seen in the distributions of bwD disk nuclei.\n\nDiscussion\nThe variegating rearrangements studied here cause a nuclear reorganization with clear consequences for the organism. The rearrangements alter the behavior of affected loci relative to wild-type (see Table S1 and part 2 of Protocol S1), changing their nuclear position. This in turn increases the likelihood that nearby genes will contact and form persistent interactions with heterochromatin. Those loci that do interact with heterochromatin may be silenced. Supporting this conclusion is the observation that variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions in silenced cells are vastly different from those of expressing cells (Figure 2D\u20132F). Silenced nuclei show a tight unimodal distribution with a peak centered around short distances, 0.5 \u03bcm in the case of bwD, and 0.8 \u03bcm in the case of In(3L)BL1 and In(1)rst3. We posit that the lower variability of these silenced cell distributions means that variegating genes are forming persistent contacts with heterochromatin. Because the same level of association was seen between recently differentiated nuclei and those that had differentiated as many as 12\u201318 h before (see Figure S2 and part 5 of Protocol S1), this suggests that the interactions are quite persistent and do not appear and disappear periodically. Distances of nearly a micron may seem inordinately high. However, since the analysis scheme measured between FISH signal centers, distances will never be zero even when FISH signals overlap considerably. This is compounded by the relatively large volume occupied by heterochromatic FISH signals. However, FISH signals that we classified as interacting based on distance were often touching or partially overlapping (Figure 1). Unlike silenced cells, expressing cells have a broader, nearly Gaussian distribution centered at 1.0\u20131.5 \u03bcm and extending to nearly 4 \u03bcm (Figure 2A\u20132C). We interpret the more variable distribution to mean that expressing loci are not interacting with heterochromatin and are therefore less restricted.\n\nDespite clear differences between expressing and silenced loci behavior, we do not see absolute distinctions between them. Appreciable numbers of silenced loci are far from cis-heterochromatin, while some expressing loci are quite close. Some of these results may be explained by limitations of our experimental procedures. Not all centromeric heterochromatin is labeled by our FISH methods. It remains possible that a \u201cfar silenced\u201d gene may be interacting with heterochromatin not labeled by our oligonucleotide probes in either cis- or trans-heterochromatin. Two lines exhibited significant association with trans-heterochromatin, suggesting that this could explain cases where silenced genes are not associated with labeled cis-heterochromatin. Some of the expressing yet heterochromatin-close cases may have expressed the gene for some time before contact with heterochromatin silenced the variegating locus. Our use of accumulated gene product to mark gene expression would mask these examples. While FISH methods do not drastically perturb nuclear structure, these methods may impact interloci distances somewhat [36,37]. Heat shock utilized for the In(3L)BL1 line may explain its unique behavior relative to other chromosomes, as heat shock has been shown to affect nuclear structure [2]. A live chromosomal imaging system [15] that tracks the long-range interactions of a variegating gene with heterochromatin should provide the best control for sample manipulations discussed here.\n\nSpecific biological interactions may also explain the \u201cfar silenced\u201d and \u201cclose expressing\u201d loci. Interaction with heterochromatin may be required for the establishment but not the maintenance of silencing. Once a gene is silenced, chromosomal motion may pull it away from centromeric heterochromatin without changing the affected gene's expression. A second possibility is that the proximal block of heterochromatin near the variegating locus can occasionally silence the gene by itself. For example, the block of heterochromatin near the white gene in In(1)rst3 is known to be a weak silencer [38]. The observation that variegating loci in some expressing cells seem to interact with heterochromatin (upper limit of 20%) may mean that interaction does not guarantee silencing. Early transcriptional activation allows a gene to escape PEV, arguing that once a gene is expressed, future interactions with heterochromatin might not silence it [39]. The timing of interaction relative to the normal expression pattern of the gene may therefore be critical. Some genes vary in their sensitivity, such that interaction with heterochromatin may not necessarily result in silencing [40,41].\n\nBased on Figure 2 and the results in Table 1, we can determine what the differences between expressing and silenced cells mean in terms of chromosomal and nuclear dimensions. In silenced cells, the median distance between the variegating locus and heterochromatin is nearly halved relative to expressing cells. For example in In(1)rst3 the distance falls from around 1.5 \u03bcm in expressing cells to 0.85 \u03bcm in silenced ones. Based upon calculations of linear base pair distance, this is what we would expect if the silenced locus is located 9 MB closer to heterochromatin than in the expressing case, or about half of a chromosome arm. Given the complex folding of an interphase chromosome arm, this reduction is likely more pronounced than a linear calculation would suggest. Additionally, the behavior of a silenced locus is different in ways far more dramatic than merely \u201ccloseness\u201d to heterochromatin. The distribution of distances for silenced loci are also less variable than for expressing loci, roughly half that of an expressing locus. This becomes particularly clear when we imagine the variegating-gene-to-heterochromatin distance in statistical terms, using two standard deviations as a 95% confidence interval. Using the In(1)rst3 case as an example, the expressing locus might be anywhere from 0 to 3 \u03bcm from heterochromatin, while the silenced locus will not be found farther than 1.7 \u03bcm away. Thinking about this in terms of three-dimensional nuclear volume, this means than an expressing locus will inhabit a 95% confidence volume five times larger than that of a silenced locus. We posit that the shorter median distance and reduced variability in position relative to heterochromatin suggests a persistent interaction.\n\nIt is not known to what extent the association of a variegating gene with heterochromatin is a cause or an effect of gene silencing. Even though our results argue that the two events are connected, a gene could be silenced by local factors and associate with heterochromatin independently. Future examinations of this problem would require a live study to pinpoint precisely when interactions occur. If interaction occurs before the gene is silenced, that suggests that the interaction could be a cause of silencing. If interactions occur after silencing, however, this would suggest that the interaction is merely a side effect. Studying the persistence of such associations will reveal whether interaction with heterochromatin causes loci to be more constrained than non-interacting loci, which could explain why gene-to-heterochromatin distance distributions from expressing cells are so much broader than those of silenced cells.\n\nNow that specific interactions with heterochromatin have been shown to be closely correlated with silencing, one can ask how such interactions form. Time-lapse studies have shown that individual loci can move substantial distances within the nucleus, eventually bringing the variegating locus into contact with heterochromatin [19]. Additional live studies found that chromosomal loci can be held in place after contacting certain structures such as the nuclear envelope or the nucleolus [42]. Once contact is made, the proximal and centromeric blocks of heterochromatin may mediate a persistent interaction through multimerization of proteins such as HP1. Loci on wild-type chromosomes will not form persistent interactions because they lack a proximal block of heterochromatin. Interestingly, studies have found that as interphase progresses, nuclear motion decreases such that contacts between euchromatic loci and heterochromatin may stabilize [19,43,44].\n\nRecent insights into the molecular behavior of heterochromatin proteins suggest how persistent interaction with heterochromatin may silence genes (reviewed in [45]). We hypothesize that the associated loci, because of intimate (possibly molecular) contact, acquire the molecular features of heterochromatin. The chromatin of PEV-silenced genes acquire heterochromatic features such as a regular nucleosome array, insensitivity to nucleases [46], and binding of heterochromatin proteins [47,48]. This altered chromatin structure seems to occlude the affected gene's promoter, preventing the loading of RNA polymerase and transcriptional activators, thereby preventing gene expression [49].\n\nA model of how LRCIs with heterochromatin occur in the eye disk is outlined in Figure 8. In dividing cells anterior to the morphogenic furrow, few loci interact with heterochromatin. As cells pass into the morphogenic furrow, the G1 cell cycle arrest allows loci to explore their chromosome territory and make contacts with regions of heterochromatin on their own and possibly other chromosomes. Loci that contact heterochromatin may form persistent interactions that cause silencing. The normal expression pattern of the white gene, for example, is now altered by association with heterochromatin. Instead of being expressed in every r8 cell behind the morphogenic furrow, as in a wild-type chromosome, its expression pattern is periodically interrupted by silenced cells. Loci that contact but do not form persistent interactions remain relatively unconstrained.\n\nFigure 8 Model of Variegating Gene Association with Heterochromatin and Its Consequences\nCartoon of eye disk showing when and where association occurs and its effects on gene silencing. Anterior is to the left. Long-range interactions are not observed anterior to the morphogenic furrow in regularly dividing cells. In the morphogenic furrow, G1 arrest allows variegating genes the time to begin to find and associate with blocks of heterochromatin. Once behind the morphogenic furrow, variegating loci in more cells associate with heterochromatin, and once formed these interactions persist. When a developmental signal is sent for a gene to be expressed, its association with heterochromatin greatly affects its chances for being expressed, such that a gene interacting with heterochromatin is far less likely to be activated than one that is not.\n\nThis is the first study to examine the expression state of a chromosomal locus and its interaction with heterochromatin on a cell-by-cell basis within intact tissue. In each of the three cases examined, relocalization of a gene to heterochromatin was tightly correlated with gene silencing. These results strongly suggest that spatial organization of the Drosophila genome is an integral part of organism function.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\n\nDrosophila strains and chromosomes\nThree classes of rearrangements were used, each representing one of Drosophila's three largest chromosomes: X, 2, and 3. Each variegates for a different gene (Table 2) and has a proximal block of heterochromatin placed into or nearby the variegating locus. It was expected that the small block of heterochromatin near the variegating gene would mediate interaction between the variegating gene and centromeric heterochromatin without silencing the variegating gene directly.\n\nTable 2 List of Rearranged Chromosomes Studied\nSatellite sequences are taken from [66]\n\nBloomington, Bloomington Stock Center, University of Indiana, Bloomington, Indiana, United States; Eissenberg, Joel Eissenberg, St. Louis University, St. Louis, Missouri, United States; Hawley, Scott Hawley, Stower's Institute, Kansas City, Missouri, United States; Henikoff, Stephen Henikoff, Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, Seattle, Washington, United States; ND, not determined; NR, not relevant\n\nThe X chromosome was represented by the line In(1)rst3 y1car1. Variegation for white was produced by mating In(1)rst3 males with virgin females of the genotype C(1)RM v, v; C(4) ci evR \u00d7 X^Y, In(1)EN, v f B; C(4) ci evR to produce normal phenotype XX/Y females and variegating X/O males [50]. X/O males were distinguished from XX/Y females by the expression pattern of white in third-instar eye disks (see Results).\n\nThe second chromosome was represented by two different lines containing the bwD insertion [51]. Experiments studying the bwD rearrangement in imaginal disk tissue were performed with larvae homozygous for the bwD chromosome. Control experiments with bwD/bw+ tissues produced identical results (data not shown). Experiments studying the long-range interactions with heterochromatin and silencing in adult eyes used the line Su(bwD)208/SM1. The In(2LR)SM1, Cy balancer carries a wild-type brown gene to allow bw variegation to be observed. The Su(bwD)208 rearrangement increased the number of expressing cells per eye from the normal bwD/bw+ expression level (<5%) to about 20%\u201330% [26]. Experiments were carried out in a scarlet (st) background to eliminate brown ommochrome pigment; brown-expressing cells appeared red against a field of white non-expressors, as opposed to red-brown expressors against a field of brown non-expressors. All gene expression experiments in adult eyes were in flies with the genotype In(2LR)SM1 Cy/Su(bwD)208; st/st.\n\nThe third chromosome was represented by the beta-galactosidase variegating line In(3L)BL1 [28]. The precise genotype for the In(3L)BL1 line is Df(1)y w, In(3L)BL1/Tm3 hb-lacZ.\n\nDiagrams of all variegating chromosomes including FISH staining of polytene chromosomes are shown in Figure 9.\n\nFigure 9 Variegating Lines and Probes Used in This Study\nVariegating lines were used for three different chromosomes, each variegating for a different gene.

Repetitive heterochromatin sequences were hybridized with hapten-conjugated DNA oligonucleotide probes. Each probe's location is presented in Figure 9A. Chromosome 3 heterochromatin was hybridized to a 46-bp DNA oligonucleotide containing the sequence (\nCCCGTACTGGT)4 corresponding to the dodeca satellite sequence. Chromosome 2 heterochromatin was hybridized to a 35-bp DNA oligonucleotide containing the sequence (\nAACAC)7. X heterochromatin was hybridized to a PCR product of 359 bp comprising the bulk of the 1.688 satellite sequence. Satellite sequences and probe construction are discussed in more detail in [52]. DNA oligonucleotides were synthesized by Invitrogen (Carlsbad, California, United States) using sequences as published in [52]. Heterochromatic probes made from these oligonucleotides were labeled with digoxygenin-conjugated nucleotides by terminal transferase. Digoxygenin-labeled probes were detected by sheep anti-dig F(ab)2 fragments coupled to Cy5 (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, New Jersey, United States).\n\n\nEuchromatic probes were made from P1 phage clones provided by the Berkeley Drosophila Genome Project and Genome Systems (St. Louis, Missouri, United States) [53,54]. Experiments with bwD lines used P1 clone DS003480, which hybridizes to 59E (Figure 9B) [9]. Experiments with the In(1)rst3 line used P1 clone DS006812, corresponding to 3C2\u20133. For the line In(3L)BL1, the P1 clone DS000374 was utilized, which hybridizes to 65D2\u20133. P1 DNA was amplified in bacteria and purified via alkaline lysis and silica gel chromatography (Qiagen Midi Tips, Qiagen, Valencia, California, United States). The purified DNA was digested with restriction endonucleases and labeled with Rhodamine 4-dUTP (FluoroRed, Amersham Biosciences) by terminal transferase as described previously [52].\n\nSample preparation\nEye imaginal disks were dissected from climbing third-instar larvae raised at 16 \u00b0C and fed on a yeast paste/glucose/agar/instant Drosophila food (Carolina Biological Supply, Burlington, North Carolina, United States) recipe. Eye disks were dissected into modified M3 medium [55] or Grace's and fixed for 15 min in 3.7% formaldehyde and Buffer A+ [56]. After fixation, disks were permeablized for 30 min in Buffer A+/0.1% Triton X-100 (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, Illinois, United States) and transferred to PBS (pH 7.4) with 0.1% Tween 20, unless specified otherwise.\n\nAdult eyes from recently eclosed (0\u20133 h) adult heads were dissected into a drop of Grace's medium and fixed for 15 min in Buffer A+/3.7% formaldehyde. Heads were transferred back into Grace's medium and the eyes cut away with a 15\u00b0 microsurgical knife (Surgical Specialties Corporation, Reading, Pennsylvania, United States). These eyes were fixed for an additional 15 min in A+/3.7% formaldehyde and then pried away from the compound lens with forceps and a scalpel modified into a scoop (made by Daron Brown, Fine Science Tools, Foster City, California, United States). Bovine serum albumin (5%) prevented eyes from sticking together.\n\nDetection of gene expression\nDetection of gene expression in In(3L)BL1 relied on immunofluorescence of the beta-galactosidase gene product after heat shock at 37 \u00b0C. Eppendorf tubes containing a 1-ml agarose plug were preheated for one hour at 37 \u00b0C in a circulating water bath. The plug was removed, larvae were placed inside the eppendorf tube, and the pre-warmed plug was loosely placed over the larvae and the tube sealed. Larvae were incubated in the water bath for 5 min, followed by immersion in a room temperature water bath and a 1 h recovery period. Eye disks were dissected, followed by blocking for 4 h in PBS +0.1% Tween 20 (PBT) plus 5% dry milk (Nestle, Solon, Ohio, United States). Disks were incubated with a mouse monoclonal antibody in PBT at a dilution of 1:1,000 (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States) for 2 h. After three 30-min washes in PBT, disks were incubated with horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-mouse secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch, West Grove, Pennsylvania, United States) at a 1:500 dilution in PBT for 1 h. After three more washes in PBT, the horseradish-peroxidase-coupled antibody was treated with fluorescent coumarin-coupled tyramide signal amplification reagents (TSA-direct, PerkinElmer Life Sciences, Wellesly, Massachusetts, United States) to develop a stable fluorescent stain that would survive FISH.\n\nDetection of gene expression in the line In(1)rst3 relied on immunofluorescence to the white gene product. Details of anti-White antibodies are presented in Figure S1 and part 1 of Protocol S1. Anti-White antibody staining proceeded as anti-beta-galactosidase staining, except that anti-White primary antibody was used at a concentration of 0.5 \u03bcg/ml in PBT and stained overnight. The primary antibody was detected by anti-rabbit horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) at dilution of 1:500, followed by treatment with tyramide as described above.\n\nFor bwD, adult eyes were embedded in polyacrylamide immediately after dissection (see below), stained with 0.5 \u03bcg/ml DAPI in PBS (pH 7.4), and imaged at low magnification with an Olympus (Tokyo, Japan) 20 \u00d7 0.8 NA lens to identify gross structural features for later realignment. Select regions of each eye were imaged under a 1.4 NA 100x lens to acquire high-resolution three-dimensional images of each nucleus. The precise positions of both high and low magnification datasets were recorded for realignment after FISH. Expressing cells were identified by their bright autofluoresence.\n\nDetection of cell cycle arrest\nExperiments to determine the role of differentiation and the cell cycle were carried out in third-instar eye disks. A rabbit anti\u2013cyclin A antibody detected the presence of G2 cyclins [34]. G1-arrested cells were identified by their location within the morphogenic furrow and the absence of cyclin A.\n\nFISH\nWhole-mount disks were processed for in situ hybridization as described elsewhere [52]. After FISH, tissues were stained in 2XSSCT with anti-Lamin antibodies [57] and an FITC-labeled goat anti-mouse secondary antibody to mark the nuclear periphery (Jackson ImmunoResearch). Before imaging, all tissues were washed three times in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and embedded in polyacrylamide pads as in [58] to support three-dimensional structure.\n\nAdult eyes were processed for FISH similar to [58] with modifications described below. Adult eyes were placed within a nail polish ring on a #1.5 20 \u00d7 30 mm coverslip in 13.5 ml of Tris (pH 8.0). Then 6.5 ml of 3X activated acrylamide buffer (Buffer A+, 15% acrylamide, and 0.333% bis-acrylamide) was added. Twenty-five microliters of 20% ammonium persulfate and 25 \u03bcl of 20% sodium sulfite were added to 500 \u03bcl of acrylamide buffer immediately before addition to tissue. The acrylamide buffer drop was mixed by repeated pipetting, and sealed with a clean 20 \u00d7 30 mm coverslip. After 30 min of polymerization, the top coverslip was removed and pads washed four times in Buffer A+, followed by DAPI staining and pigment imaging.\n\nAfter pigment imaging, pads were stepped into 2XSSCT/50% formamide and incubated with probe and hybridization solution overnight at 37 \u00b0C before denaturation. Pre- and post-FISH washes proceeded as described for eye disks in PCR tubes, except that washes were extended to 1 h apiece in humid chambers with agitation. Eyes were denatured as described elsewhere [52,58], except that denaturation was extended to 10 min. After FISH, eyes were washed five times with 50% formamide/2xSSCT, stepped into PBT, and stained with DAPI.\n\nThree-dimensional imaging\nBefore mounting, all tissues were washed three times in 50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) to remove any detergent. Disks were mounted in Vectashield (Vector Labs, Burlingame, California, United States) while adult eyes were mounted with ProLong (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States). Three-dimensional imaging was carried out on a computer-controlled epifluorescence microscope [59,60]. All images were collected on a Peltier-cooled CCD camera (Photometrics, Tucson, Arizona) connected to an SGI Indigo2 workstation (SGI, Mountain View, California, United States). Imaginal disks were imaged with a 60x Olympus 1.4 NA oil lens while adult eyes were imaged on an Olympus 20 \u00d7 0.8 NA oil lens followed by a Nikon (Tokyo, Japan) 100 \u00d7 1.4 NA oil lens. For adult eyes, the same tissues examined for pigmentation were re-imaged and carefully aligned with pre-FISH images. Data were processed after collection by a constrained iterative deconvolution software program [61].\n\nImage analysis\nImage analysis was performed with the Image Visualization Environment software package PRIISM ([62]; D. Diggs and E. Branlund, unpublished data). The Water algorithm automatically identified nuclei [63] and segmented them into three-dimensional objects. After segmentation the center point of each object was the starting point to find the nuclear periphery. The nuclear lamin signal was found by searching for pixels above an intensity threshold a specified radial distance from the center point. Pixels above the threshold were marked and refined by a second- and third-order surface harmonic expansion [10]. Individual FISH signals within each modeled nucleus were identified based on their intensity peak above background (M. Lowenstein and D. Diggs, unpublished data). FISH signal distances were measured and sorted by nucleus membership. Distances were measured from the intensity-weighted center of mass rather than from the edge of each FISH signal. This means that even overlapping FISH signals will return a measured distance. Differences between different groups of nuclear distances were tested for statistical significance by the Mann\u2013Whitney U test (see Table 1), which is a two-sample rank-sum test for position that makes no assumptions regarding the distributions of sample data [64].\n\nPlots and statistical comparisons were performed by the Statview 4.5 (Abacus Concepts, Berkeley, California, United States) analysis program. Results are summarized in Table 2.\n\nData presentation\nGroups of distances mentioned previously were tested for statistical significance relative to one another (see Table 1). Variegating chromosomal loci close to heterochromatin were considered to be interacting, while loci farther away were considered to be not interacting. Data were presented in two different ways. First, standard histograms presented the full distribution of the data including any subpopulations. Second, cumulative percentile plots with percent association between variegating genes and their own centromeric heterochromatin plotted as a function of gene-to-heterochromatin distance more clearly distinguished varying interaction levels between different cell populations. This plotting method also revealed that the exact placement of a cutoff for interaction between loci was unimportant, as clear differences could be seen at distances less, equal to, or greater than 1 \u03bcm. As a general rule 1 \u03bcm in distance was used as a cutoff for interaction. This cutoff was not intended to be mechanistically meaningful, but to serve as a rule of thumb for thinking about the results.\n\nMonte Carlo analysis and correlation between nuclear distances and nuclear dimensions\nDistance distributions in eye disk nuclei were compared to pairwise distances measured from 50 points randomly placed within the nucleus. Also, distances between chromosomal loci were examined for their sensitivity to nuclear shape and volume. Data and results are presented in Table S2 and parts 3 and 4 of Protocol S1.\n\nSupporting Information\nProtocol S1 Anti-White Antibody Generation, and the Effects of Gene Expression, Nuclear Dimensions, and Time on Gene to Heterochromatin Distances\n(31 KB DOC).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Figure S1 Production and Characterization of Anti-White Antisera\nFull details available in Materials and Methods.\n\n(A) Western blots showing specificity of antibody for a single polypeptide of approximately 70 kDa in larval (L) and adult (A) extracts.

To answer this question, we probed synaptic connections with several hundred simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the rat visual cortex. Analysis of this dataset revealed several nonrandom features in synaptic connectivity. We confirmed previous reports that bidirectional connections are more common than expected in a random network. We found that several highly clustered three-neuron connectivity patterns are overrepresented, suggesting that connections tend to cluster together. We also analyzed synaptic connection strength as defined by the peak excitatory postsynaptic potential amplitude. We found that the distribution of synaptic connection strength differs significantly from the Poisson distribution and can be fitted by a lognormal distribution. Such a distribution has a heavier tail and implies that synaptic weight is concentrated among few synaptic connections. In addition, the strengths of synaptic connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons are correlated, implying that strong connections are even more clustered than the weak ones. Therefore, the local cortical network structure can be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones. Such a skeleton is likely to play an important role in network dynamics and should be investigated further.\n\nA dataset of hundreds of recordings in which four neurons were simultaneously monitored reveals clustered connectivity patterns among cortical neurons\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nUnderstanding cortical function requires unraveling synaptic connectivity in cortical circuits, that is, establishing the wiring diagrams. Although smaller wiring diagrams can be reconstructed using electron microscopy [1], reconstruction on the scale of a cortical column is impossible with current technology (but see [2] for a promising approach). Even if such a possibility were within reach, synaptic connectivity likely varies from animal to animal and within one animal over time. Therefore, a reasonable approach is to describe synaptic connectivity statistically, or probabilistically. Such statistical description may be based on random sampling of connections with multineuron recordings [3,4,5]. For example, electrophysiological recordings from neuronal pairs showed that the probability of connection is often low [3,5,6,7,8,9,10,11], suggesting that the network is sparse. Such statistical approaches may create the impression that synaptic connectivity in local cortical circuits is random. This view is consistent with previous suggestions [12,13,14], but hard to reconcile with cortical functionality, which must rely on specificity of connections [15,16,17,18].\n\nIn general, statistical sampling of connections does not imply that the underlying network has random connectivity. Indeed, statistical sampling has already revealed several nonrandom features in cortical connectivity. In particular, specific connectivity patterns exist between different classes in the local circuit [3,19,20]. Within one putatively homogeneous class, the number of reciprocally connected pairs is greater than expected in a random network [5,6,11]. Distribution of the number of synapses per connection is non-Poisson and has low variance [6,21]. At the same time, the distribution of the connection strength is broad [5,6,10,11]. But many questions remain unanswered: Are there nonrandom features in patterns involving more than two neurons? What is the distribution of synaptic connection strength? Are synaptic connection strengths correlated?\n\nRecently, new approaches for network connectivity analysis have been developed and various nonrandom features were discovered in natural and man-made networks. In particular, many networks are scale-free, that is, the number of connections per node (node degree) often follows a power-law distribution [22]. Also, many networks exhibit the small-world property, that is, high local clustering of connections in combination with a short path between any two nodes [23,24]. In addition, probability of connection between nodes depends on how many connections they have [25]. Although local cortical networks may possess these properties, existing connectivity data are not sufficient for such analyses. These data are obtained by random sampling of connections and call for other approaches. One such approach is to explore local structures in network connectivity by studying the distribution of few-node connectivity patterns, or motifs [26,27]. Another such approach is analyzing the utilization (or, in this case, the strength) of connections [28,29,30].\n\nIn this paper, we apply a combination of statistical methods to a large dataset from hundreds of simultaneous quadruple whole-cell recordings from visual cortex in developing rats. Our results confirm previous indications of nonrandomness and point out several new ones. In particular, we show that the distribution of connection strengths between pyramidal neurons is non-Poisson and find correlations in the strength of the connections sharing pre- or postsynaptic neurons. Also, we find several overrepresented three-neuron connectivity patterns, or motifs. Surprisingly, we find that some few-neuron motifs can play an important role in the dynamics of layer 5 local cortical networks because they are composed of exceptionally strong connections. This suggests a novel view of the local cortical network, in which a skeleton of stronger connections is immersed in a sea of weaker ones.\n\nResults\nWe studied connectivity among thick tufted layer 5 neurons in rat visual cortex with quadruple whole-cell recordings (Figure 1A and 1B). Thick tufted layer 5 pyramidal neurons are important projection neurons from the cerebral cortex to subcortical areas [9,31,32]. Synaptic connection strengths were assessed by evoking action potentials in each of the four cells and measuring the averaged peak excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes in the other three cells (see Figure 1C and Materials and Methods). Results of these measurements for a sample quadruple recording are shown in Figure 1D. Each arrow indicates a detected connection with the corresponding connection strengths. The dataset contained a total of 816 quadruple recording attempts (some of these attempts contained data for only two or three neurons, if whole-cell configuration was not successfully established with all four cells). As previously reported [5], the rate of connectivity was p = 11.6% (931 connections out of 8,050 possible connections), which is similar to that reported for rat somatosensory cortex layers 5 [6,9] and 2/3 [11], as well as those previously reported for rat visual cortical layers 5 [3,10] and 2/3 [11].\n\nFigure 1 Illustration of a Quadruple Whole-Cell Recording\n(A) Dodt contrast image showing four thick-tufted L5 neurons before patching on.\n\n(B) Fluorescent image of the same four cells in whole-cell configuration.\n\n(C) Average EPSP waveform measured in the postsynaptic neuron (bottom) while evoking action potentials in the presynaptic neuron (top).\n\n(D) Diagram of detected synaptic connections and their strengths for this quadruple recording.\n\nTwo-Neuron Patterns\nWe started by assessing how well a randomly connected network [33] describes our dataset. In this model, the existence of a connection between any two neurons is independently chosen with a uniform probability p (Figure 2A). We test the predictions of this model by classifying all simultaneously recorded pairs of neurons into three classes: unconnected, unidirectionally connected, and bidirectionally connected. Given connection probability p and total number of pairs N, the expected number of unconnected pairs should be N(1 \u2212 p)\n2. The expected number of unidirectionally connected pairs should be 2Np(1 \u2212 p), and the expected number of bidirectionally connected pairs should be Np2. We find that the actual number of bidirectionally connected pairs is four times that of the expected numbers (p < 0.0001) (Figure 2B). The observed overrepresentation of reciprocally connected layer 5 neurons confirms previous reports [5,6]. Such overrepresentation has also been observed in layer 2/3 of the rat visual cortex [11]. However, whether projections between layers observe this pattern remains an open question.\n\nFigure 2 Two-Neuron Connectivity Patterns Are Nonrandom\n(A) Null hypothesis is generated by assuming independent probabilities of connection.\n\n(B) Reciprocal connections are four times more likely than predicted by the null hypothesis (p < 0.0001, Monte Carlo simulation to test for overrepresentation). Numbers on top of bars are actual counts. Error bars are standard deviations estimated by bootstrap method.\n\nCan the overrepresentation of reciprocal connections reflect an experimental artifact? Indeed, such overrepresentation could arise from a nonuniform probability of connection for different neurons. For example, connection probability may depend on interneuron distance. To control for this artifact, we measured distances between neurons in recordings where labeling was performed successfully. We found that the probability of connection does not depend systematically on the interneuron distance (p = 0.21, chi square test) (Figures 3, S1, and S2). This is not surprising because most neurons were located closer than the span of their dendritic (and especially axonal) arbors. Our result is consistent with Holmgren et al.'s study [11], which found only a small (22%) decrease in connection probability up to 50 \u03bcm, with a more significant drop (44%) up to 100 \u03bcm for layer 2/3 pyramidal neurons.\n\nFigure 3 Probability of Connection among Adjacent Neurons Does Not Depend Strongly on the Interneuron Distance\n(A) Relative location of labeled neurons in the plane of the section. Positive direction of y-axis is aligned with apical dendrite. Potentially presynaptic neuron is located at the origin.

Error bars are 95% confidence intervals estimated from binomial distribution.\n\nAnother source of nonuniformity in connection probability may be axonal arbors being cut off differentially, depending on the depth of the recorded neuron from the slice surface. (The recording depths were from 10 to 100 \u03bcm.) To explore such a possibility we measured the dependence of the connection probability on the recording depth. Neither connection probability, nor strength of connection was found to depend systematically on the recording depth (see Figure S3). In addition, for every successfully labeled tissue we measured the distance from the average cell position to the nearest axonal cut point (see Figure S3). Again no strong trends in connection probability or connection strength were found. These results show that the cutting artifact is unlikely to explain observed nonrandom features.\n\nWe also considered the possible artifact of connection probability varying with age. We found a weak decline in connection probability and EPSP amplitude (consistent with Reyes and Sakmann [34]) within the range used in experiments (P12\u2013P20; see Figure S4). Yet, such a decline is insufficient to account for the observed nonrandomness. To demonstrate this, we repeated most of the analysis on a subset of the data from 14 to 16-d-old animals when the majority of measurements were performed (see Figure S5). We found that bidirectional connections are also overrepresented in this subset of data. Results of other analyses that will be described later in the paper are also confirmed on this subset (Figure S5).\n\nFinally, it is possible that some extreme degree of inhomogeneity in connections probability is able to explain the observed overrepresentation of reciprocal pairs, but this would probably reflect large local inhomogeneity in cortical connectivity patterns\u2014possibly differences between subclasses [6,35], rather than experimental artifacts\u2014and is in line with the main conclusions of this paper.\n\nThree-Neuron Patterns\nWe extended our analysis by comparing the statistics of three-neuron patterns to those expected by chance [26,27]. We classify all triplets into 16 classes and count the number of triplets in each class. In order to avoid reporting overrepresented three-neuron patterns just because they contain popular two-neuron patterns, we have revised the null hypothesis[26,27]. The control distribution was obtained numerically by constructing random triplets where constituent pairs are chosen independently, but with the same probability of bidirectional and unidirectional connections as in data (Figure 4A). For example, the actual probability of a unidirectional connection is (according to Figure 2B) 495/(3312 + 495 + 218) = 0.123. Then the probability of unidirectional connection from A to B is 0.123/2 = 0.0615, the same as from B to A (see Figure 4A). The probability of bidirectional connection is (according to Figure 2B) 218/(3312 + 495 + 218) = 0.0542. The probability of finding the particular triplet class in Figure 4A by chance is the product of the probabilities of finding the three constituent pairs and a factor to account for permutations of the three neurons. The ratio of the observed counts and the expected counts for each class are plotted in Figure 4B. The actual counts are given as numbers on top of the bars. Although triplets from several of these patterns have been reported previously [9,10], small numbers of recordings have precluded statistical analysis.\n\nFigure 4 Several Three-Neuron Patterns Are Overrepresented as Compared to the Random Network\n(A) Null hypothesis for three-neuron patterns assumes independent combinations of connection probabilities of two kinds of two-neuron patterns.\n\n(B) Ratio of actual counts (numbers above bars) to that predicted by the null hypothesis. Error bars are standard deviations estimated by bootstrap method.\n\n(C) Raw (open bars) and multiple-hypothesis testing corrected (filled bars) p-values. p-values above 0.5 are not shown.\n\nAccording to Figure 4B, several triplet patterns are overrepresented. Is this overrepresentation statistically significant? Because we look for overrepresentation in many pattern classes at the same time, the raw p-values (Figure 4C) overestimate the true significance (underestimate the true p-value). To correct the raw p-values, one has to apply a multiple-hypothesis testing procedure. We chose to correct the p-values by applying a step-down min-P-based multiple-hypothesis testing correction procedure (see Materials and Methods). The corrected p-values (Figure 4C) give the probability of mistakenly reporting at least one of the patterns as overrepresented when it is not.\n\nTwo-neuron correlations are summarized by saying that if neuron A synapses onto neuron B, then the probability of B synapsing onto A is several times greater than chance. Three-neuron correlations are summarized roughly by saying that if A connects with B and B connects with C (regardless of direction), the probability of connection between A and C is several times greater than chance. Interestingly, similar results have been obtained in the analysis of the Caenorhabditis elegans wiring diagram [36], which was reconstructed from serial section electron microscopy [1]. Because different techniques have different biases, the similarity of results suggests that correlations in synaptic connectivity represent a general property of neuronal circuits. Such property may represent evolutionary conservation from invertebrates to mammals or convergence driven by similar computational constraints.\n\nAlthough individual connectivity patterns containing more than three neurons could not be analyzed statistically for the existing dataset (Table S1), we found a 70% overrepresentation of \u201cchain\u201d quadruplets (patterns number 21 23 24 26 28 29 31 32 33 34 35 38 39 41 43 as defined in Figure S6, p = 0.004) relative to the null hypothesis requiring that a random matrix has the actual proportion of triplet classes.\n\nDistribution of Synaptic Connection Strengths\nNext, we turned our attention to the distribution of synaptic connection strengths as characterized by EPSP amplitude (Figure 5A). We estimated the probability density function by binning connection strengths and dividing the number of occurrences in each bin by the bin size. Since there are many more weak connections than strong ones, we chose bins whose sizes increase linearly with the connection strength at the bin center. In other words, bin sizes are uniform on the log scale. The estimated density function is independent of the chosen bin size since the bin size is divided out.\n\nFigure 5 Distribution of Synaptic Connection Strength Has a Heavy Tail\n(A) Estimated probability density function in log\u2013log space, with both lognormal fit (p[w] = 0.426exp[\u2212(ln[w] + 0.702)2/(2 \u00d7 0.9355)2]/w) and exponential fit (p[w] = 1.82exp[\u22121.683w]). Notice that the lognormal fit has a heavier tail than the exponential distribution. Error bars are standard deviations estimated by bootstrap method (not shown when narrower than the dot). The numbers on top on the dots are the actual counts (not shown when more than 50).\n\n(B) Estimated probability density distribution in semilog space, with the lognormal fit. The lognormal function shows up as a normal function in the semilog space.\n\n(C) Empirical cumulative density function for both the probability distribution of synaptic strengths and the synaptic contribution (normalized product of probability and connection strength). They are generated directly from the data rather than the fits. The vertical line illustrates the fact that 17% of the synaptic connections contribute to half of the total synaptic strengths.\n\n(D) Probability density function of synaptic connection strengths p(w) fitted by a lognormal function and the synaptic contribution defined as the product of the strength, w, and p(w). The total areas under both curves are normalized to 1.\n\nThe obtained distribution has a mean of 0.77 mV and a heavy tail, that is, a greater number of strong synaptic connections than expected for either the exponential distribution (Figure 5A) or the normal distribution (not shown). There are significantly more connections with strengths above 1 mV than expected by best exponential or normal fit (p < 0.0001; see Materials and Methods). We find that the dataset is best fit by a lognormal distribution, which has a bell shape when plotted on a semilog scale (Figure 5B). Although our measurements were performed in developing animals, experiments in mature animals have also revealed large single EPSPs (>5 mV) [37].\n\nThe overrepresentation of strong synaptic connections is likely to have important implications for the cortical network dynamics. This is because strong connections are few but powerful. For example, although synaptic connections with strength above 1.2 mV constitute only 17% of all connections, they contribute about half of the total synaptic weight (Figure 5C and 5D). This estimate was obtained by multiplying the number of synaptic connections by the connection strengths (assuming equal presynaptic firing rates).\n\nCorrelation of Connection Strengths in Two-Neuron Patterns\nNext, we analyzed the correlations between the strengths of the synaptic connections in two-neuron patterns. We find that the synaptic strengths of the bidirectional connections are on average stronger than the unidirectional synaptic connections (mean 0.95 mV versus 0.61 mV, p = 3.1 \u00d7 10\u22127, Student's t-test) in agreement with [6]. The distribution of connection strengths for the bidirectional connections is expanded toward stronger connections compared to that of unidirectional connections (Figure 6A; note the semilog scale). Furthermore, the strengths of the two connections in a bidirectional pair are moderately but significantly correlated with each other (Figure 6B). To control for possible systematic variations between different quadruplets, we looked at correlations in the strength of synaptic connections that shared no pre- and postsynaptic neurons and found no significant correlation (Figure 6C). Could the correlation in connection strength result from nearby neurons having stronger connections? We do not think so because the strengths of bidirectional connections do not depend strongly on the distance between neurons (Figure 6D).\n\nFigure 6 Bidirectionally Connected Pairs Contain Connections That Are Stronger and Correlated\n(A) Synaptic connections in bidirectionally connected pairs are on average stronger than those in unidirectionally connected pairs. The probability density distribution for both the reciprocal (red solid, p(w) = 0.41exp(\u2212(ln w + 0.60)2/(2 \u00d7 0.9762)/w) and nonreciprocal (blue dashed, p(w) = 0.47exp(\u2212(ln w + 0.81)2/(2 \u00d7 0.8342)/w) connections are shown.\n\n(B) In bidirectionally connected pairs synaptic connection strengths are moderately but significantly correlated (R = 0.36, p < 0.0001).\n\n(C) Scatter plot of the strength of synaptic connections that shared no pre- and postsynaptic neurons in the same quadruple recording. There might be other connections in the quadruplet besides these two connections. No significant correlation is observed (R = 0.068, p = 0.48). All correlations calculated using Pearson's R method in log space.\n\n(D) Average connection strength for bidirectional connections does not vary systemically with interneuron distance (one-way ANOVA, p = 0.068). Numbers on top of data points are the number of connections. Error bars are standard errors of the mean.\n\nAnother way to characterize correlations in connection strengths is by analyzing the overrepresentation of the bidirectional motif for different synaptic-strength thresholds. For every threshold value, we modify the dataset by keeping only those synaptic connections that exceed this threshold. In a unidirectionally connected pair, connection is kept only if its strength exceeds the threshold. In a bidirectionally connected pair, if both connections exceed the threshold, they are both kept. If only one of the connections exceeds the threshold, the pair becomes unidirectionally connected. Then we predict the numbers of bidirectional synaptic connections that exceed threshold by using the null model assuming independent probability, as was done for two-neuron patterns. The actual number of bidirectional connections exceeding the threshold is compared with the predicted. We find that, as the threshold is raised, the ratio of actual to expected number of bidirectional connections monotonically increases (Figure 7). This shows that reciprocity of connections is greater for stronger connections.\n\nFigure 7 Stronger Connections Are More Likely Reciprocal than Weaker Ones\nOverrepresentation of bidirectionally connected motifs gets more dramatic for higher threshold of connection strength (counts differ from random with p < 0.001 for all thresholds, Monte Carlo simulation). Significance of monotonicity is assessed by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p < 3.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 for all successive pairs). Numbers on top of dots show the counts of actual pairs.\n\nThree-Neuron Patterns with Strong Connections\nWe also analyzed the overrepresentation of three-neuron patterns as a function of threshold. Because of small numbers of patterns in some classes, we have grouped highly connected patterns (boxed patterns in Figure 8) together and calculated the measured counts relative to random for different thresholds. Similar to the two-neuron motifs, overrepresentation of the highly connected motifs gets more dramatic as the threshold is raised (Figure 8). Although the numbers of overrepresented three-neuron patterns are small, they may contribute to the neuronal dynamics in nontrivial ways, for example, by supporting recurrent activity. Furthermore, the contribution of three-neuron patterns depends on the chosen connection strength threshold. The relative fraction of overrepresented patterns in the network of stronger connections is much greater than that in the network of weaker connections.\n\nFigure 8 Stronger Connections Are More Clustered than Weaker Ones\nRelative overrepresentation of highly connected three-neuron motifs monotonically increases as the threshold is raised (counts differ from random p < 0.001 for all thresholds, Monte Carlo simulation). Significance of monotonicity is assessed by applying the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (p <3.5 \u00d7 10\u221210 for all successive pairs). Numbers show the actual triplet counts. For the second to highest threshold, two instances of pattern 12 and one instance of pattern 16 survive. For the highest threshold, one instance each of pattern 12 and 15 survive (one of the connections in pattern 16 drops out and it becomes pattern 15).\n\nIn addition, we analyzed the strengths of synaptic connections made onto the same neuron, synaptic connections coming out of the same neuron, and synaptic connections onto and out of the same neuron (Figure S7). These strengths are weakly correlated. Correlations in the strength of incoming or outgoing connections may suggest, although not conclusively prove, the presence of neurons with particularly strong connections. Such neurons may be analogous to \u201cnetwork hubs,\u201d or nodes with particularly large numbers of connections (degrees), which are known to exist in other networks [22,38].\n\nDiscussion\nWe showed that synaptic connectivity in the local network of layer 5 pyramidal neurons is highly nonrandom. The network consists of sparse synaptic connections that tend to cluster together in the form of overrepresented patterns, or motifs. The distribution of connection strengths has a significant tail; strong connections are few but powerful and even more clustered than the weak ones. These results suggest that the network may be viewed as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker ones (Figure 9). Interestingly, the existence of few but powerful synaptic connections makes analyzing the network with few-neuron connectivity patterns a reasonable first step. Indeed one could have thought that, since each neuron receives inputs from thousands of others collectively determining its dynamics, analysis of few-neuron motifs is akin to \u201csearching under the street light.\u201d Yet, the finding of a heavy tail in the connection strength distribution suggests that a lot of power is due to a few connections. Therefore, our analysis has illuminated a significant part of the local cortical architecture, especially if the stronger connections are distributed uniformly among neurons. Naturally, this description is not complete, and future studies should investigate whether stronger synaptic connections are distributed among neurons uniformly or belong preferentially to \u201chub\u201d neurons. Also, studies involving larger networks of neurons will be needed to provide a more complete understanding of the network structure and function.\n\nFigure 9 Statistically Reconstructed Network of 50 Layer 5 Pyramidal Neurons Illustrates That Stronger Connections form a Skeleton Immersed in a Sea of the Weaker Ones\nDetails of statistical reconstruction are given in Materials and Methods. For illustrative purposes, neurons are arranged so that strongly interconnected nodes are close by. Dotted arrows are weak (<1 mV) unidirectional connections; solid arrows are weak bidirectional connections. Red arrows are strong (>1 mV) unidirectional connections with arrow size indicating the strength. Red arrows with double lines are strong bidirectional connections.\n\nAlthough broad distribution of synaptic connections strength has been seen in the cortex [6,11] and in the cerebellum [39], heavy-tailed distributions have not been suggested as suitable fits previously. For example, in the feed-forward projection from granule to Purkinje cells in the cerebellum, the distribution was fitted by a truncated Gaussian distribution, argued to be optimal for information storage [40]. It would be interesting to see if analogous theory could be developed to explain the lognormal distribution seen among the layer 5 pyramid recurrent connections. Another relevant observation is that of mini-EPSC amplitudes [41], which were fitted by a Poisson distribution based on a binomial model of the data. In this case, however, we are looking at direct unitary connections between pairs of neurons rather than individual synapses, and such direct connections between nearby cortical neurons are typically comprised of multiple individual synapses [6,21,34,42]. Evoked and spontaneous release may also produce different synaptic strength distributions because the underlying molecular mechanisms are different. Alternatively, the lognormal distribution could depend on network activity patterns not present in dissociated cultures.\n\nTo illustrate the possible impact of the skeleton of strong connections on the network dynamics, let us consider a local network of layer 5 neurons occupying the 300 \u03bcm \u00d7 300 \u03bcm area. According to Peters et al. [43], there are 4,480 thick tufted layer 5 neurons under 1 mm2 of cortex, and therefore 400 thick tufted neurons in the considered network. With a connection probability of 0.11, each neuron receives inputs from 44 others. If distribution of connection strength is uniform among neurons, then each neuron has only about 2\u20133 connections in the greater than 2-mV range. If the corresponding 2\u20133 presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, they may drive the postsynaptic neuron to fire. This suggests that a sparse skeleton of strong connections may drive the dynamics of the network. An exceptionally strong connection (>10 mV) may alone drive a postsynaptic neuron to fire. Suprathreshold EPSPs have been observed previously with paired recordings [37,44,45] and with calcium imaging [46]. However, such connections occur with a very low probability (about 1/1000, estimated from lognormal distribution), meaning that there are only about 20 of such connections in the considered network and that therefore most neurons do not have them. Finally, inhibitory neurons may make it more difficult to drive a postsynaptic neuron to fire and need to be investigated.\n\nBecause the highly influential, strong, and reliable (Figure S8) synaptic connections in the network are few in number, their exact connectivity pattern and properties might therefore be important and make firing patterns of the involved cortical neurons highly reproducible. This may be manifested in the simultaneous activation of several neurons in organized patterns during spontaneous and evoked activity that has been observed in cortical slices [47,48,49,50] and elsewhere [51,52,53,54]. Unfortunately, most current experimental studies rely on random sampling of neurons appropriate for studying the properties of average connections rather than the particularly strong connections. It might be important in the future to devise methods to selectively study particularly strong connections, because of their anticipated large influence on network dynamics [35,49].\n\nAlthough stronger connections are likely to be important for network dynamics, weaker connections need to be considered as well. Collectively, they could affect the dynamics of the network significantly and might carry out computations with a population code. The weaker connections may be a potent driving force if firing is correlated between neurons. In addition, weaker connections may serve as a potential reserve for cortical plasticity. Indeed, weaker connections could be strengthened easily through a variety of activity-dependent learning rules (see below for an example).\n\nIn neurobiological literature, synaptic connections have been classified previously by their impact into \u201cdrivers\u201d and \u201cmodulators\u201d [55]. Drivers are less numerous and produce stronger impact than modulators. We stopped short of calling stronger connections among layer 5 pyramidal neurons drivers, and weaker connections modulators, for two reasons. First, previously drivers and modulators have been used to describe inputs arising from a priori different subsets of neurons, such as different pathways. Second, we do not find a clearly bimodal distribution of connections strength, suggesting that the distinction between stronger and weaker connections is not clearly defined enough to warrant two separate classes.\n\nNext, we consider how observed distributions of synaptic strength and correlations between them might have arisen. Although it is possible that the neurons bound by stronger connections form a distinct subclass defined by perhaps distinct long-range projection patterns, or different channel densities and/or gene expression patterns, it is also possible that the distributions arise as a natural consequence of activity-dependent plasticity rules.\n\nThe lognormal distribution of synaptic connection strength may be explained by a random multiplicative process, which has been extensively studied previously [56,57,58,59]. The idea behind this is demonstrated below. Suppose a synaptic connection changes its strength multiplicatively after ith plasticity episode. This can be expressed as\n\n\n wi = Fiwi-1 ,\n \n\n\nwhere wi is the synaptic connection strength after ith plasticity episode, and F\ni is the fractional change in synaptic strength induced by that episode. Then it is easy to see that\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere wn is the current synaptic connection strength, w\n0 is the initial synaptic connection strength, and Fis are the fractional changes in synaptic connection strength. If we assume all Fis to be independent and identically distributed with finite mean and variance, then by applying central limit theorem, log wn should obey a Gaussian distribution, which implies that wn obeys a lognormal distribution. For a more rigorous treatment, a decay term has to be added to make the distribution stationary, which is analogous to the Gompertz stochastic growth model in ecology [56,59] (also see Appendix S1). In a network, the fractional change in synaptic connection strengths due to long-term potentiation (LTP) would have complex dependencies both on current synaptic connection strength and on correlated activity in the network. In a previous study of layer 5 pyramidal cells, we found only a weak\u2014although statistically significant\u2014dependence of the percentage amount of LTP on the pre-LTP EPSP amplitude so that fractional synaptic change due to LTP was in effect approximately constant for most synaptic strengths [5]. Studies in other brain areas have found a more marked negative dependency [60,61,62]. However, this negative dependency could be counterbalanced by the stronger correlation between presynaptic and postsynaptic firing patterns introduced by a stronger synaptic connection. Regardless, it is curious that a simple independency assumption, together with synaptic decay, reproduces the observed distribution, despite the complex interactions in the network. How this is achieved warrants further investigation.\n\nCan the overrepresentation of bidirectional connections and the correlation in the reciprocal connection strength arise from known learning rules? For example, the synaptic connections studied in this paper are known to obey a temporally asymmetric spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule [5,8], in which the strength of a synaptic connection changes according to the timing of pre- and postsynaptic spikes. If a presynaptic spike shortly precedes a postsynaptic spike, the synaptic connection is strengthened. Conversely, if a presynaptic spike follows a postsynaptic spike, the synaptic connection is weakened. Simulations have shown that in a recurrent network, if effects of spike pairs are assumed to sum linearly, this rule leads to underrepresentation of bidirectional motifs, instead of the overrepresentation observed here [63], because the firing statistics are exactly reversed for the reciprocal synaptic connections. However, for highly correlated firing of pre- and postsynaptic cells, depending on the relative durations and amplitudes of the long-term potentiation and long-term depression temporal windows, more potentiation than depression may be triggered for connections going both ways [64,65]. Furthermore, nonlinear spike interactions are known to operate at those synapses. In particular, the spike-timing-dependent plasticity rule becomes temporally symmetric if the pre- and postsynaptic neurons fire at higher than 50 Hz [5]. Whether these factors can explain this discrepancy, or additional factors need to be considered, remains to be studied.\n\nIn a wide range of networks, there is a power-law relationship between the numbers of connections a particular node has (its degree) and the abundance of such nodes [66]. These networks have been termed scale-free networks [22]. In particular, such a power-law distribution of the number of connections a neuron makes has been reported in C. elegans [22]. Here, we have not studied the degree distribution because of the lack of adequate data (such as, for example, the full connectivity diagram for the cortical network). We instead analyzed the strengths of the connections and found a lognormal distribution of synaptic connection strengths, which has a heavy tail, similar to the power-law distribution. Similar distributions have been observed in many nonbiological networks [67,68]. In the biological setting, using an in silico model of metabolic flow in yeast, Almaas et al. [28] found that network use is highly uneven and dominated by several \u201chot links\u201d that represent high-activity interactions that are embedded into a web of less active interactions. Such heavy-tailed distribution for connection strengths has also been suggested based on experimental data for metabolic flow and gene regulation networks [29,30]. Therefore, a heavy-tailed distribution for connection strengths along with clustering of stronger connections into a backbone might represent a novel universal feature of many networks, in addition to the power-law distribution of number of connections commonly discussed. Such an arrangement would give the stronger links a larger role in the network and might represent a hierarchal organizational scheme of the network structure [38].\n\nIn conclusion, the statistics of connectivity in a local network of layer 5 tufted pyramidal neurons are highly nonrandom and bear similarities to other biological networks. The cortical network is best visualized as a skeleton of stronger connections in a sea of weaker connections. These findings are likely to have important implications for cortical dynamics.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nElectrophysiology\nThe dataset used for this study was originally used for the study of long-term plasticity, and the methods were previously described in detail [5,69]. Briefly, acute visual cortical slices were cut from rats aged P12\u2013P20. Rats were anesthetized with isoflurane, decapitated, and the brain was rapidly removed to ice-cold artificial cerebrospinal fluid (in mM: NaCl, 126; KCl, 3; MgCl2, 1; NaH2PO4, 1; CaCl2, 2.5; NaHCO3, 25; dextrose, 25; osmolality 320 mOsm, bubbled with 95% O2/5% CO2 [pH 7.4]). Slices were used after at least 1 h of incubation, and up to 11 h after slicing. Recordings were done at 32\u201334 \u00b0C.\n\nWhole-cell recording pipettes (5\u201310 M\u03a9, 1\u20132 \u03bcm diameter) were filled with (in mM): KCl, 20; (K)Gluconate, 100; (K)HEPES, 10; (Mg)ATP, 4; (Na)GTP, 0.3; (Na)Phosphocreatine, 10; and 0.1% w/v biocytin, adjusted with KOH to pH 7.4, and with sucrose to 290\u2013300 mOsm. Thick tufted L5 neurons were identified at 400X magnification using IR-DIC optics (Olympus BX-50; Olympus, Melville, New York, United States). To ensure that arborizations of recorded L5 neurons were minimally damaged during dissection, slices were used only if L5 apical dendrites were approximately parallel with the slice surface and could be traced most or all of the way to the pial surface. Gigaohm seals were then established on four neurons, after which breakthroughs were performed in quick succession. In some cases, one or two breakthroughs failed, thus yielding triple or double recordings; connections found in these cases were included in the dataset. Signals were amplified with AxoPatch 200B, AxoPatch-1B, and AxoClamp 2B amplifiers (Axon Instruments, Foster City, California, United States) and filtered at 5 kHz. Acquisition was done at 10 kHz using MIO-16E boards (National Instruments, Austin, Texas, United States) and custom software running on Igor Pro (WaveMetrics, Lake Oswego, Oregon, United States) on Macintosh computers (Apple Computer, Cupertino, California, United States). Recordings were terminated if membrane potential changed more than 8 mV or input resistance (measured from 250-ms-long 25 pA hyperpolarizing pulses preceding each trace) changed more than 30% from the baseline.\n\nMeasurement of synaptic connection strengths\nWe assessed connectivity by averaging ten or more traces. Synaptic connection strength was calculated by averaging the peak EPSP amplitudes (measured using a 1-ms-long window centered on the peak of the averaged EPSP trace) from 45 to 60 responses obtained during a 10- to 15-min-long baseline period just after breakthrough. In some cases (less than 5%), the EPSP amplitude was determined from fewer than 45 responses (although never fewer than 10 responses), typically because the recordings failed. The standard deviation of EPSP amplitude is within 0.04\u20131.4 mV and depends weakly on the mean EPSP amplitude (see Figure S8). As the averaged EPSP waveforms were time-locked to the presynaptic spike, the signal-to-noise ratio was good enough to allow for detection of synaptic connections with strengths as low as 0.01 mV. However, as only ten traces were averaged to determine connectivity, we might have missed connections with very low release probability.\n\nAnalysis and statistics\nTo evaluate correlations in synaptic connection strength, Pearson's R is calculated using the following standard formula:\n\n\n  \n\n\nwhere X and Y are vectors of paired samples and N is the total number of pairs. The p-value score of significance is calculated based on Fisher's z-score calculated from R. For synaptic connection strengths of reciprocally connected pairs, assignment of connection strengths as X and Y would be arbitrary. Therefore, the R value calculated should not depend on the assignment. We use each pair of X, Y values twice when calculating the R score. For each pair Xi, Yi, the pair constructed by flipping the order also entered in the formula; therefore, N is twice the total number of pairs. When calculating the p-value, the number N is taken to be the total number of pairs instead of twice the total number, so as not to overestimate the significance. The correlation scores and p-values calculated this way agree with those calculated from a reshuffling procedure by randomly assigning each neuron as either X or Y and using each pair only once.\n\nTo analyze the distribution of synaptic connection strength, we generated fits to the data, by using a mean-square error-based procedure from the MATLAB curve-fitting toolbox in the log\u2013log space. To test whether the experimental distribution has a longer tail than the exponential or Gaussian distribution, we chose a threshold T, and counted the number of experimental observations with higher value than T, and denoted it by n, out of a total of N observations. We then calculated the p-value as the probability of generating more than n observations with values larger than T out of N observations from the null distributions.\n\nTo assess the monotonicity in Figures 7 and 8, we used the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. For each threshold of synaptic connection strength, we generated an ensemble of 1,000 random matrix sets with matched connection statistics as described in the Motif finding section below. We then computed the distribution of ratios between occurrence counts in the random ensemble and the observed occurrence counts for motif(s) of interest. These ratios are the inverses of the ratios plotted in Figures 2 and 4 in order to avoid division by zero. We then tested for monotonicity between successive pairs of distributions with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test.\n\nTo generate bootstrap distributions for a dataset with N observations, we drew an ensemble of 1,000 trials of N samples each from the dataset with replacement and computed the appropriate statistic on each trial. The statistics from these trials formed the bootstrap distribution. Mean and standard deviations were then computed on the bootstrap distribution of the chosen statistic.\n\nMotif finding\nTo find overrepresented motifs, we used a statistic based on how the observed counts compare with the expected counts from the null hypothesis. For the null hypothesis, we generated B = 1,000 sets of random connection matrices. Each set contained as many matrices as the number of quadruplets in experimental data. The randomization procedure is as follows: In the two-neuron case, the probability that neuron A is connected with neuron B is the same as experimentally measured, and the connection from B to A is treated independently. In the three-neuron case, each neuron pair is treated as one unit, and the probabilities of having one-way and bidirectional connections within the pair are the same as measured. But how the three pairs form a triplet is random. In the four-neuron case, a 90 \u00d7 90 matrix of connections was generated. The fractional counts for each triplet motif to total triplet counts from this big matrix were matched to experiment data using a simulated annealing procedure (see [36]). To generate each random connection matrix in each of the B = 1,000 sets of matrices, we randomly picked four neurons from this 90 \u00d7 90 random connection matrix to form a 4 \u00d7 4 random connection matrix. This procedure matches the probability of observing a triplet motif to experimental data while randomizing how triplets combine to form quadruplets.\n\nFor each motif, we counted the number of its occurrences in measured data and in each set of random matrices. The p-value for this motif is the fraction of random matrices with occurrence counts above or below the observed occurrence counts. This tests for significant deviation from random, including both overrepresentation and underrepresentation.\n\nSince we are testing for many motifs simultaneously, we applied the step-down min-P-based algorithm for multiple-hypothesis correction [70,71,72]. This procedure ensures weak control for the familywise error rate, which is defined as the probability of at least one type I error (stating that a pattern is overrepresented when it is not) among the family of hypotheses (all motifs). Weak control refers to the fact that type I error is controlled under the complete null hypothesis when all the null hypotheses are assumed to be false. Strong control, which is not used here, would control type I error rate under any combination of true and false null hypotheses, but is harder to achieve. The idea behind the step-down procedures is to order hypotheses according to the raw p-values in ascending order. Then for a chosen cutoff p-value, the hypotheses are considered successively. For each hypothesis, we test for the possibility of committing at least one type I error for the subset of hypotheses with lower or equal raw p-values. Further tests depend on the outcomes of earlier ones. As soon as one fails to reject a null hypothesis, no further hypotheses are rejected. The real procedure combines the testing for all cutoff p-values into one procedure, as described in more detail below.\n\nFirst, we test for M motifs with an ensemble R of B random matrix sets, R = {Rb,b \u2208 {1,\u2026,B}} generated as described above. For each motif i \u2208 {1,\u2026,M}, we calculate the mean occurrence counts over the ensemble and denote it with c\u00afRi\n(step 1). Second, we calculate the raw p-values p*i\nfor each motif i for the two-sided statistic T, defined as the absolute value of the difference between the observed counts c and the mean ensemble counts, T = |c \u2212 c\u00afRi|\n. We calculate the proportion of sets of random matrices in the ensemble with a larger or equal value for statistic T than observed.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nfor i = 1,\u2026, M (step 2). Third, we then order the raw p-values such that p*k1\n>p*k2\n> \u2026 >p*kM\n(step 3). Fourth, for each Rb,b \u2208 {1,\u2026,B} and each motif ki,i \u2208 {1,\u2026,M}, we repeat step 4: count its number of occurrences cki,b\nin Rb, calculate T = |cki,b \u2212 c\u00afRi|\nand the p-value, pki,b,\nas in step 2, and then compute qki,B = minl=k1,\u2026,kipl,b,\n, the successive minima of the raw p-values (step4). Fifth, the corrected p-values p\u02dck1\nare estimated by calculating the proportion of sets of random matrices in the ensemble in which qki,b\nis smaller than or equal to the observed p-value p*k1\n.\n\n\n\n  \n\n\nfor i = 1,\u2026,M (step 5). Finally, we enforce the monotonicity constraints by successively setting p\u02dcki\nto max(p\u02dcki\u22121,p\u02dcki\nfor i = 2,\u2026,M (step 6).\n\n\nStatistical reconstruction of the network\nTo generate Figure 9, links were assigned randomly among 50 nodes with the experimentally measured probability of unidirectional and bidirectional connections. Strengths of connections were drawn from the experimentally measured distribution. Then we manually adjusted the connections to have roughly similar probability of occurrence of three-neuron motifs. In constructing this diagram, we assumed that each individual cell has the same distribution of strong and weak synaptic connections. This assumption could be violated if some cells have many stronger synaptic connections while others have few or none. Whether this is the case should be investigated in future studies. This figure is for illustration purposes only.\n\nPositions of recorded neurons\nTo investigate the dependence of connectivity on pairwise distances, we measured the relative coordinates of the recorded cells from slices prepared by biocytin histochemistry after recordings. Distances were not corrected for tissue shrinkage. Since we were most interested in the relationship between connectivity and distance, an equal amount of shrinkage for all slices would not affect our results. Some inhomogeneities of shrinkage were likely, but we did not expect the shrinkage factor to vary greatly across slices.\n\nDuring recording sessions, the approximate relative positions of cells and the positions of recorded quadruplets in the slice were kept in notes. In most cases, these drawings allowed unambiguous identification of recorded cells, and cell positions were then measured on those cases after identification of the recorded cells. If a quadruplet was totally unconnected, drawings were not provided. However, totally unconnected cells did not have to be identified, and the assignment was made randomly. In some cases, some of the cells in the quadruplet were not well stained. If positions of at least three cells out of the quadruplet could be recovered, the positions of those cells were recorded.\n\nWe defined the position of each cell as the three-dimensional coordinate of the axonal initial segment and measured it using the Neurolucida system (MicroBrightField, Williston, Vermont, United States). We estimate the measurement error to be less than 2 \u03bcm in X and Y positions and less than 3 \u03bcm in Z positions, based on repeated measurements of the same quadruplets. In about 10% of the cases, the initial segment of the axon was obscured by other cells and could not be positively identified, and the cell position was instead measured from the middle of the base of the cell body. In these cases, the measurement error could be as large as 3 \u03bcm in X and Y and 5 \u03bcm in Z. For each slice, we also estimated the average position of the main apical dendrites of the quadruplet around 300 \u03bcm away. The positive direction for the vector from the mean positions of the cells to the estimated average position of the main apical dendrites was defined to be the pia direction in the slice. We rotated the original relative coordinates of pairs in the X, Y plane so this vector pointed in the positive Y direction. We normalized the vector and defined it as the original coordinates of the new unit Y vector. The new unit X vector is the normal direction to the unit Y vector. To calculate the relative X, Y coordinates of two cells in the new coordinates, we took the dot product of the relative vector calculated in the original coordinates and the unit X and Y vectors, also defined in the original coordinates. The relative Z coordinates were not subject to rotation. Notice that rotation was done on the relative positions of any two cells and not on the positions of each individual cell.\n\nA total of 817 cells in 83 triplets and 142 quadruplets were measured, resulting in a total of 2,202 possible connections. For each possible connection, the relative position of the target neuron to the originating neuron was plotted in Figure 3A. If a connection was present and was involved in a bidirectional connection, the position was indicated with red. If a connection was present, and the reciprocal connection was not present, the position was indicated with blue. If a connection was not present, regardless of the status of the reciprocal connection, the position was indicated with green. Most of the cells included in the dataset came from nearby positions (<50 \u03bcm, 82% of pairs), with the remaining 18% of the connections in the 50 \u03bcm\u2013110 \u03bcm range (Figure 3B). The densities of red, green, and blue connections are proportional to each other regardless of the distance from the soma. The connection probability is mostly uniform within the range of three-dimensional distances recorded in the experiments (Figure 3C). However, the connection probability for all distances (0.013) is slightly higher than that calculated for the entire dataset (0.0116). This is likely due to less efficient recovery of unconnected quadruplets, as less care was taken to preserve them. The connection strengths do not vary with distance systematically (data not shown), although the distance does seem to have an effect (p = 0.02, one-way analysis of variance).\n\nTo control for cutting artifacts, we have measured the closest cut ending of the main axons out of the four cells in the quadruplet to the mean position of the cell bodies. The main axons go toward white matter to innervate subcortical structures. When the distance is small, then we might have cut off more portions of the axonal arbor, and cutting artifact might be a concern. However, since the main axons start branching approximately 100 \u03bcm from the cell bodies [73], the local connectivity might not be greatly affected (see Figure S3).\n\nWe also measured the Z coordinate of the slice surface. From this coordinate and the coordinate of the cells, we can deduce the depth of each cell from the slice surface. Cells closer to the surface might have had larger portions of their axonal arbors cut off, which would reduce their connectivity. However, the connectivity seems to be fairly uniform regardless of the depth of either the originating cell or the target cell (see Figure S3). The caveat is that the measurements we have taken from the fixed slices are uncorrected for shrinkage, and differential shrinkage in the Z direction might have randomized a trend that might otherwise be present.\n\nSupporting Information\nAppendix S1 Properties of the Lognormal Distribution\n(39 KB DOC).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Figure S1 Connectivity and Mean Synaptic Strengths of the Connections Are Uniform for All Distances between a Pair of Neurons\nFor the x-axis, positive means the receiving cell is to the right of the sending cell in the slice.

However, the ratio calculated for all distances (3.0) is a bit lower than that calculated for the entire dataset (4.0), probably owing to increased connection probability (0.013 versus 0.0116) caused possibly by inefficient recovery of totally unconnected quadruplets.

Cleavage of the Scc1 subunit of cohesin by the protease separase releases the complex from chromosomes and thereby enables the separation of sister chromatids in anaphase. In vertebrate cells, the bulk of cohesin dissociates from chromosome arms already during prophase and prometaphase without cleavage of Scc1. Polo-like kinase 1 (Plk1) and Aurora-B are required for this dissociation process, and Plk1 can phosphorylate the cohesin subunits Scc1 and SA2 in vitro, consistent with the possibility that cohesin phosphorylation by Plk1 triggers the dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms. However, this hypothesis has not been tested yet, and in budding yeast it has been found that phosphorylation of Scc1 by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 enhances the cleavability of cohesin, but does not lead to separase-independent dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes. To address the functional significance of cohesin phosphorylation in human cells, we have searched for phosphorylation sites on all four subunits of cohesin by mass spectrometry. We have identified numerous mitosis-specific sites on Scc1 and SA2, mutated them, and expressed nonphosphorylatable forms of both proteins stably at physiological levels in human cells. The analysis of these cells lines, in conjunction with biochemical experiments in vitro, indicate that Scc1 phosphorylation is dispensable for cohesin dissociation from chromosomes in early mitosis but enhances the cleavability of Scc1 by separase. In contrast, our data reveal that phosphorylation of SA2 is essential for cohesin dissociation during prophase and prometaphase, but is not required for cohesin cleavage by separase. The similarity of the phenotype obtained after expression of nonphosphorylatable SA2 in human cells to that seen after the depletion of Plk1 suggests that SA2 is the critical target of Plk1 in the cohesin dissociation pathway.\n\nCohesin holds newly replicated chromosomes together until a cell is ready to divide. These authors show how phosphorylation regulates cohesin function\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nFaithful inheritance of the genome depends on its accurate replication and correct distribution to the two daughter cells. In eukaryotes, the two copies of a chromosome that are generated in S-phase (sister chromatids) remain connected until they are separated in anaphase of mitosis. This physical association (cohesion) allows the mitotic segregation machinery to handle sister chromatids as entities that have to be distributed to opposite poles. Sister chromatid cohesion depends on cohesin, a protein complex that is highly conserved in evolution and consists of at least four subunits: two \u201cstructural maintenance of chromosomes\u201d proteins, Smc1 and Smc3, the so-called \u201ckleisin\u201d subunit Scc1 (also called Rad21 or Mcd1), and Scc3 (reviewed in [1]). Cells of humans, Xenopus, and other higher eukaryotes contain two mitotic orthologs of Scc3, called SA1 and SA2. Cohesin complexes in these cells contain either SA1 or SA2, but not both [2,3].\n\nIn order to segregate sister chromatids to opposite poles in anaphase, cohesin has to be removed from chromosomes. In budding yeast, the prevalent mode of cohesin removal is by proteolytic cleavage of the Scc1 subunit at the onset of anaphase by the endopeptidase separase [4,5]. Prior to anaphase, separase is kept inactive by its inhibitor securin [5,6,7,8,9,10], and in vertebrate cells also by inhibitory phosphorylation mediated by Cdk1 [11]. Both securin and Cdk1's activating subunit cyclin B are ubiquitinated at the onset of anaphase by the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome, leading to their proteasome-dependent degradation and to separase activation (reviewed in [12]).\n\nIn higher eukaryotes, removal of cohesin from chromosomes occurs in at least two steps. During prophase and prometaphase, the bulk of cohesin dissociates from chromosomes without Scc1 cleavage [3,13]. Only minor amounts of cohesin (an estimated 10%) remain on chromosomes up to metaphase, preferentially at centromeres [10,14]. A similarly minor amount of cohesin, presumably the chromosome-bound fraction, is cleaved by separase at the onset of anaphase [10]. As in budding yeast, the cleavage of Scc1 is essential for anaphase to occur [15]. Two mitosis-specific protein kinases are required for the cleavage-independent removal of cohesin from chromosome arms: Plk1, called Plx1 in Xenopus, and Aurora-B [16,17,18]. Plk1/Plx1, but not Aurora-B, can phosphorylate the cohesin subunits Scc1 and SA2 in vitro [16,17], and is required for their phosphorylation in Xenopus egg extracts [16]. In these extracts, the ability of cohesin to bind to chromatin correlates inversely with its phosphorylation state [16]. This observation, and the finding that Plk1 is required for cohesin dissociation from chromosomes, raise the possibility that phosphorylation of cohesin by Plk1 leads to its cleavage-independent dissociation from chromosomes. However, it is unknown whether Plk1's critical target in the cohesin dissociation process is cohesin itself, and whether cohesin phosphorylation is required for dissociation of the complex from chromosomes. So far, the functional relevance of cohesin phosphorylation has been studied only in budding yeast. In this organism, Scc1 is also phosphorylated by a Polo-like kinase, called Cdc5, but this modification does not seem to result in cohesin's dissociation from chromatin; rather, it renders Scc1 more susceptible to cleavage by separase [19,20].\n\nTo test whether cohesin phosphorylation is required for its dissociation from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase, and to address whether this modification could explain the requirement for Plk1 in this process, we have searched for phosphorylation sites on all four subunits of the human cohesin complex by mass spectrometry. We have identified numerous mitosis-specific sites on Scc1 and SA2, mutated them, and expressed wild-type and nonphosphorylatable forms of both proteins stably at physiological levels in cultured human cells. The analysis of these cell lines, in conjunction with biochemical experiments in vitro, imply that Scc1 phosphorylation is dispensable for cohesin dissociation from chromosomes in early mitosis, but enhances the cleavability of Scc1 by separase. In contrast, our data reveal that phosphorylation of SA2 is essential for cohesin dissociation during prophase and prometaphase, but is not required for cohesin cleavage by separase. The similarity of the phenotype obtained after expression of nonphosphorylatable SA2 (this study) to that seen after the depletion of Plk1 [18] strongly suggests that SA2 is the critical target of Plk1 in the cohesin dissociation pathway.\n\nResults\nIdentification of Mitosis-Specific Phosphorylation Sites on Human Cohesin\nThe SA1, SA2, and Scc1 subunits of vertebrate cohesin complexes are phosphorylated specifically in mitosis [2,14,16]. To be able to analyze the functional relevance of these modifications, we mapped mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites on human cohesin by mass spectrometry. We prepared lysates from HeLa cells that had been arrested either at the G1/S transition (interphase) by hydroxyurea or in mitosis by the spindle poison nocodazole, and immunoprecipitated SA1- and SA2-containing cohesin complexes with antibody 447, which recognizes the C termini of both SA1 and SA2 [3]. Separation of the isolated proteins by SDS-PAGE and staining with silver (Figure 1A) or cohesin-specific antibodies (Figure 1B) demonstrated reduced electrophoretic mobility of both SA1 and SA2 when the complexes had been isolated from mitotic cells, indicating that the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of these subunits was preserved during the isolation procedure. This notion was confirmed by immunoblotting with phosphothreonine-specific antibodies. This assay yielded a pattern that was consistent with the presence of phosphothreonine residues on SA1, SA2, and Scc1 in mitosis, whereas no phosphothreonine signal was detected on cohesin subunits isolated from interphase cells (Figure 1B).\n\nFigure 1 Identification of Mitosis-Specific Phosphorylation Sites on Human Cohesin\n(A and B) Cohesin was immunoprecipitated by antibody 447 (which recognizes SA1 and SA2) from extracts prepared from HeLa cells that were either arrested in S-phase by hydroxyurea (HU) or in mitosis by nocodazole (Noc). Cohesin was eluted by buffer of low pH and analyzed by (A) silver staining and (B) immunoblotting with antibodies to cohesin subunits and phosphorylated threonine (P-Thr).\n\n(C) Schematic representation of the phosphorylation sites on Scc1 and SA2 that were identified by mass spectrometry, and of the mutant versions of the proteins that have been generated. The star indicates a phosphorylation site that was found in both interphase and mitotic Scc1. All SA2 constructs used for in vitro experiments lack the 69 N-terminal amino acids. SA2-WT-myc and SA2\u201312xA-myc cell lines contain the entire open reading frame of 1,231 amino acids.\n\nTo identify phosphorylation sites, purified cohesin complexes were digested with various proteases in solution and analyzed by high performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (HPLC-ESI-MS/MS). In total, 28 phosphorylated serine or threonine residues were identified. Of these, 18 could be assigned unequivocally to specific residues, whereas in ten cases it could not be determined which of several serine and threonine residues in a given peptide was phosphorylated (Figure 1C and Table 1). Two sites each were found in Smc1 and Smc3, ten in Scc1, and 14 in SA2. We were unable to identify phosphorylated peptides derived from SA1, presumably because SA1-containing cohesin complexes are much less abundant than SA2-containing complexes [2,3]. By analyzing cohesin peptides obtained by digestion with various proteases, we were able to obtain a sequence coverage of approximately 80% for each of the subunits (Figure S1 and unpublished data). This indicates that our analysis was theoretically able to identify the majority of in vivo phosphorylation sites on cohesin subunits, although we cannot exclude the possibility that some sites have gone undetected.\n\nTable 1 Phosphorylation Sites Identified in Cohesin Subunits\nWhere two or more residues are marked, the phosphorylation site could not be unequivocally assigned to any one of the adjacent residues\n\n+, phosphorylated; ++, highly phosphorylated\n\nDOI: 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030069.t001\n\nThe phosphorylation sites we identified on Smc1 and Smc3 were present in complexes from both interphase and mitotic cells, and we therefore did not analyze them any further. Two of these sites (Ser966 and Ser957 in Smc1) have been shown to be phosphorylated by the ATM kinase in response to DNA damage [21,22]. Only one of the sites in Scc1 (Ser153), and none in SA2, was found phosphorylated in interphase. All other sites were only identified in cohesin samples from mitotic cells. These results confirm that Scc1 and SA1/2 are specifically phosphorylated in mitosis.\n\nSince Plk1/Plx1 can phosphorylate Scc1 and SA1/SA2 in vitro and is required for the phosphorylation of these subunits in Xenopus egg extracts [16], we compared the sequence surrounding the identified sites to the consensus sequences that have been reported as binding and phosphorylation sites for Plk1. The C-terminal Polo box domain of Plk1 binds to phosphorylation sites for which the consensus S-[pT/pS]-[P/x] has been proposed [23]. These phosphorylation sites are thought to be generated by proline-directed kinases, such as Cdk1, that \u201cprime\u201d the substrate for subsequent recognition by Plk1. Once bound to the substrate, Plk1 is thought to phosphorylate sites that are distinct from the one that is recognized by the Polo box. Based on in vitro phosphorylation experiments using peptides derived from the phosphatase Cdc25C, Nakajima et al. [24] have proposed the consensus (E/D)-x-(S/T)\u03a6-x-(E/D) for Plk1 phosphorylation-sites, where \u03a6 signifies a hydrophobic amino acid, whereas Barr et al. [25] have suggested the consensus (E/D/Q)-x-(S/T)\u03a6. One putative phosphorylation site in Scc1 (Thr186) and three putative sites in SA2 (Ser1065, Thr1124, and Ser1178) match the Polo box-binding consensus sequence, although none of these sites contains a proline residue at the +1 position (these are putative sites because they are present in peptides in which the exact identity of the residue carrying the phosphomoiety could not be determined; Table 1). We also note that, although Cdk1 can phosphorylate SA1/2 in vitro [2], it does not appear to be essential for cohesin dissociation in human cells and Xenopus egg extracts [3,16]. Two phosphorylation sites in Scc1 (Thr144 and Thr312) match the consensus proposed by Nakajima et al. [24]. These two sites, in addition to one in Scc1 (Ser454) and three in SA2 (Thr1109, Ser1137, and Ser1224) conform with the consensus proposed by Barr et al. [25]. These findings are consistent with the possibility that at least some of the sites in Scc1 and SA2 are directly phosphorylated by Plk1.\n\nAlignment of multiple sequences showed that most of the amino acid residues that we found to be phosphorylated in mitotic human Scc1 and SA2 were conserved in orthologs from other vertebrates, but not in more distantly related eukaryotes such as Drosophila, Caenorhabditis elegans, or yeast, where the homology to human cohesin subunits is in overall much lower (unpublished data). When we considered the distribution of the sites, we found that Scc1 phosphorylation sites strikingly clustered around the two separase cleavage sites, whereas SA2 phosphorylation sites were concentrated in the C terminus of the protein (Figure 1C). Clustering of Scc1 phosphorylation sites in the vicinity of separase cleavage sites has also been observed in budding yeast [19]. This indicates that, although individual sites on Scc1 are not conserved from yeast to human, the overall pattern of phosphorylation is conserved. Evolutionary conservation of the overall mitotic phosphorylation pattern, but not of individual sites, has also been observed in the case of the anaphase-promoting complex/cyclosome [26].\n\nPhosphorylation of Scc1 Is Required for Efficient Cleavage by Separase In Vitro\nIn budding yeast, phosphorylation of Scc1 by the Polo-like kinase Cdc5 enhances the rate of cleavage by separase both in vitro and in vivo [19,20]. We therefore analyzed whether treatment of human Scc1 with Plk1 similarly increases its cleavability by separase (Figure 2). We activated purified human separase-securin complexes by securin destruction in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts and incubated the activated separase with 35S-labeled recombinant Scc1 as a substrate. Under these conditions, separase cleaves Scc1 at the same sites that are cleaved at anaphase onset in vivo, Arg172 and Arg450 ([15]; Figure 2A). When untreated Scc1 was incubated with separase, efficient cleavage could only be detected at the more N-terminal site, resulting in the formation of one N-terminal and one C-terminal cleavage product which could be seen by Phosphorimager analysis (Figure 2A and 2B). The C-terminal cleavage product could also be detected by immunoblotting using antibodies to a myc-epitope tag on the C-terminus of Scc1 (Figure 2A). When the cleavage reaction was carried out in the presence of active recombinant Plk1, cleavage at the first Scc1 site was slightly enhanced, and cleavage at the second site now became apparent (Figure 2A and 2B), consistent with the possibility that phosphorylation of Scc1 by Plk1 increases the cleavability of Scc1. A cleavage product that corresponds to the fragment in between the two cleavage sites could not be detected under these conditions (Figure 2A), indicating that separase cleaves either one or the other site in one Scc1 molecule, but not or only rarely both.\n\nFigure 2 Plk1 Facilitates Cleavage of Human Scc1 by Separase In Vitro\n(A) Recombinant, 35S-labeled, wild-type and mutant Scc1 (see Figure 1C) tagged with 9xmyc at the C terminus were incubated with human separase. Recombinant human GST-Plk1 was added to the reaction mixtures where indicated. Samples were withdrawn from the reactions at the indicated time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by immunoblotting (anti-myc) and Phosphorimager analysis (35S exposure). Arrows indicate full length Scc1-myc (fl), C- and N-terminal fragments resulting from cleavage at Arg172 (Ct #1, Nt #1, respectively), and C- and N-terminal fragments resulting from cleavage at Arg450 (Ct #2, Nt #2, respectively). The lower parts of the membrane or gels were exposed longer than the upper parts. The enhancement of cleavage at Arg172 by Plk1 can be seen particularly well by comparing the intensities of the N-terminal fragments (Nt #1). Note that in the autoradiographs a band can be seen (particularly clearly in the lanes representing the zero time points) that has almost the same electrophoretic mobility as cleavage product Ct #1. This band is distinct from Ct #1 because it migrates a slightly shorter distance and because it is also present in the absence of separase. This band was therefore not included in the quantification in (B).\n\n(B) Quantification of the abundance of Scc1-myc and the Scc1-myc cleavage fragments in the assay shown in the left autoradiograph of (A). For the quantification, autoradiographs of identical exposure were used. The sum of the intensities of full-length and all cleavage fragments was set to 100%. Signal intensities for N- and C-terminal fragments resulting from cleavage at the same site were summed.\n\n(C) Chromatin fractions were prepared from HeLa cells stably expressing either wild-type Scc1-myc or the mutant Scc1-S454A-myc, and were incubated in either interphase or mitotic Xenopus egg extract. Mitosis-specific cleavage of Scc1 was detected by immunoblotting with myc antibodies.\n\nWe suspected that the observed enhancement of Scc1's cleavability in the presence of Plk1 might be due to phosphorylation at two sites that are directly adjacent to the cleavage sites, Ser175 and Ser454, which we had found to be phosphorylated in mitosis in vivo (Table 1). We therefore mutated these two residues to alanine, thereby creating mutant Scc1-S175A/S454A (see Figure 1C), and tested the cleavability of this mutant in the absence or presence of Plk1 in vitro. Scc1-S175A/S454A could still be cleaved at the first site, and this reaction was still slightly enhanced in the presence of Plk1, but cleavage at the second site was completely abolished even in the presence of Plk1 (Figure 2A and 2B). This result suggested that cleavage at Arg450 of Scc1 by separase depends on phosphorylation of Ser454. The analysis of a Scc1 mutant in which only Ser454 was changed to alanine (Scc1-S454A) confirmed this notion (unpublished data; see Figure 2C for a related result). Next, we asked whether the enhancement of cleavage at Arg172 upon incubation with Plk1 is due to phosphorylation of any of the other residues we had identified. We therefore created a Scc1 mutant in which nine of the ten identified phosphorylation sites were mutated to alanine (Scc1\u20139xA; see Figure 1C). Mutation of the tenth site was not possible for technical reasons. When Scc1\u20139xA was incubated with active separase, we found, as expected, that cleavage at Arg450 was abolished, but cleavage at Arg172 did occur and was still enhanced by the addition of Plk1 (unpublished data). At present, it is therefore unclear how Plk1 enhances cleavage of Scc1 at Arg172. The effect could be due to phosphorylation of one or more of the serine and threonine residues at positions 185\u2013189 (Table 1), which were not included in our mutational analysis; alternatively, it might be due to phosphorylation on one or more residues that our mass spectrometry analysis failed to identify. It also remains a formal possibility that Plk1 enhances cleavage at Arg172 by phosphorylating separase rather than cohesin.\n\nScc1 Phosphorylation Is Not Essential for the Dissociation of Cohesin from Chromosome Arms and for Progression through Mitosis\nTo address the physiological significance of Scc1 phosphorylation and the resulting enhanced cleavability of Scc1, we generated cell lines that stably express Scc1-S454A or Scc1\u20139xA (Figure 3; see also Figure 1C). To be able to distinguish the ectopically expressed Scc1 proteins from endogenous Scc1, we tagged the Scc1 mutants with nine myc epitopes at their C termini. We have shown that such a tag does not detectably compromise the ability of Scc1 to assemble into cohesin complexes [10] that can establish cohesion [15]. Since expression of mutant Scc1 could have deleterious effects on cells, we furthermore used a doxycycline-regulatable promoter to be able to control the level of expression. To avoid potential overexpression artifacts, we screened by immunoblotting for cell lines in which the ectopically expressed Scc1 is present in amounts that are similar to the amounts of endogenous Scc1 when expression is fully induced by doxycycline (Figure 3A). Immunoprecipitation of the ectopically expressed Scc1 with myc antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining, revealed that the mutated forms of Scc1 could associate with Smc1, Smc3, and SA1/2 into cohesin complexes (Figure 3B; note that endogenous untagged Scc1 does not coimmunoprecipitate with Scc1-myc, indicating that only one Scc1 molecule is present per cohesin complex). Sucrose density gradient centrifugation experiments in conjunction with immunoblotting showed that most of the ectopically expressed Scc1 was incorporated into cohesin complexes (Figure S2A). These observations indicate that any phenotypes (but also the absence of phenotypes) that are observed after ectopic expression of Scc1 are not simply caused by overexpression or by the inability of Scc1 to assemble into cohesin complexes.\n\nFigure 3 Characterization of HeLa Cell Lines Stably Expressing Wild-Type or Mutant Forms of Human Scc1 and SA2\n(A) Wild-type Scc1 or SA2, or the indicated mutant proteins (see Figure 1C), all tagged with 9xmyc at the C terminus, were stably and inducibly expressed in HeLa tet-on cells. After induction by treatment with 2 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 1\u20133 d, cell extracts were prepared from either logarithmically proliferating cells (i, interphase) or from cells arrested in mitosis by nocodazole (m, mitosis), then immunoblotted. In the case of Scc1 cell lines (upper blots), only data from interphase extracts are shown. Exogenous protein was detected by immunoblotting with myc antibodies (lower blots). Since the 9xmyc-tag caused a reduced mobility in SDS-PAGE compared to the endogenous protein, Scc1- and SA2-immunoblots (upper blots) revealed the relative amounts of exogenous and endogenous protein in the different cell lines. The position of molecular weight markers is indicated on the right side.\n\n(B) Extracts were prepared from the different cell lines as indicated. Immunoprecipitation was performed using myc antibodies, followed by SDS-PAGE and silver staining. As a control, the cohesin complex was immunoprecipitated from untransfected HeLa tet-on cells using antibodies to SA2.\n\n(C) Extracts were prepared from SA2-WT-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc expressing cells, and fractionated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation (5%\u201330% sucrose), followed by immunoblotting with antibodies recognizing the proteins indicated on the right (inp. = input/unfractionated sample of the extract).\n\nTo analyze whether mutation of Ser454 abolishes cleavage of Scc1 at Arg450 also when Scc1 is part of cohesin complexes that have been loaded onto chromatin in vivo, we incubated chromatin from HeLa cells expressing wild-type Scc1, Scc1-S454A, or Scc1\u20139xA in Xenopus egg extracts. In this assay, Scc1 is cleaved by separase at Arg172 and Arg450 if the Xenopus egg extract is in a mitotic state [10], presumably because separase and Plx1 are active under these conditions. Whereas wild-type Scc1 was efficiently cleaved at both sites in mitotic egg extract, we did not observe any fragment resulting from cleavage at Arg450 when either Scc1-S454A or Scc1\u20139xA was analyzed (Figure 2C and unpublished data), further supporting the conclusion that phosphorylation at Ser454 of Scc1 is essential for cleavage at Arg450.\n\nImmunofluorescence analysis demonstrated that the localization of Scc1-S454A and Scc1\u20139xA was very similar to the one of wild-type Scc1 (Figure S2B and unpublished data). Both mutants were present in nuclei from telophase through interphase until the next mitosis. In prometaphase, the bulk of mutant cohesin complexes had dissociated from chromosome arms, but small amounts remained at centromeres, even if prometaphase was prolonged by treatment of the cells with nocodazole (Figure S2B). Scc1 phosphorylation at the nine mutated sites is therefore essential neither to load cohesin onto chromatin nor to remove cohesin from chromosome arms in early mitosis. Furthermore, we were unable to observe obvious abnormalities at later stages of mitosis and in the overall ability of cells expressing nonphosphorylatable Scc1 to proliferate (unpublished data), indicating that Scc1 phosphorylation at the mutated sites is not essential for the ability of separase to cleave cohesin complexes and to initiate anaphase. The finding that cells expressing Scc1 in which residue 454 cannot be phosphorylated and in which cleavage at Arg450 is therefore compromised (see Figure 2C) do not show anaphase defects is in agreement with our previous observation that Scc1 cleavage at Arg172 is sufficient for the viability of HeLa cells [15].\n\nPhosphorylation of SA2 Is Essential for the Dissociation of Cohesin from Chromosomes during Prophase and Prometaphase\nThe observation that nonphosphorylatable Scc1 mutants bind chromatin in interphase and dissociate from chromosome arms normally in early mitosis implied that the requirement for Plk1 in cohesin dissociation and the inhibitory effect of cohesin phosphorylation on chromatin binding [16,18] cannot be explained by Scc1 phosphorylation. We therefore asked whether phosphorylation of SA2 might control the association of cohesin with chromosomes. We generated a mutant of SA2 in which serine/threonine residues at 12 sites found to be phosphorylated in mitosis in vivo were mutated to alanine; this mutant was called SA2\u201312xA (see Figure 1C). We C-terminally tagged this mutant and wild-type SA2 with myc epitopes and expressed both in HeLa cells in a stable and inducible manner, employing the same strategy that we had used for Scc1. Also in this case we isolated cell lines in which the levels of ectopically expressed SA2 are similar to the levels of endogenous SA2 (Figure 3A). Immunoprecipitation experiments with myc antibodies and sucrose density gradient centrifugation showed that both the tagged SA2 wild-type and SA2\u201312xA proteins were incorporated into cohesin complexes (Figure 3B and 3C).\n\nSince SA2 phosphorylation can be catalyzed by purified Plk1 in vitro and depends on Plx1 in Xenopus egg extracts [16] we asked whether SA2\u201312xA had lost the ability to be phosphorylated by Plk1. When purified cohesin complexes were incubated with Plk1 and 32P-\u03b3-ATP, approximately 50% less radiolabel was incorporated into SA2\u201312xA than into wild-type SA2, whereas phosphorylation of Scc1 in the same complexes was not affected (Figure 4A). Because both budding yeast and human Polo-like kinases can phosphorylate many sites in vitro that are not phosphorylated in vivo [26,27], it is possible that the residual phosphorylation of SA2\u201312xA by Plk1 in vitro occurs on sites that are not phosphorylated in vivo. We therefore analyzed the phosphorylation of wild-type and mutant forms of SA2 under more physiological conditions by incubating 35S-labeled recombinant SA2 in mitotic Xenopus egg extracts. SA2 phosphorylation in these extracts depends on Plx1 [16] and causes an electrophoretic mobility shift (Figure 4B). This shift was partially abolished when three C-terminal phosphorylation sites were mutated (mutant SA2\u20136/7/11; see Figure 1C), and no shift could be seen with SA2\u201312xA (Figure 4B). These results indicate that most mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites have been removed from SA2\u201312xA. The finding that mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites in SA2 are clustered in the C terminus was also confirmed by generating deletion mutants in which SA2 was progressively shortened from the C terminus (see Figure 1C), because SA2's mobility shift was completely abolished when at least 124 C-terminal residues were removed (Figure 4C).\n\nFigure 4 Mutations of the C-Terminal Phosphorylation Sites and C-Terminal Deletions Decrease the Mitotic Phosphorylation of SA2\n(A) Cohesin complexes containing wild-type SA2-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc were immunopurified by myc antibodies from the respective cell lines. Similar amounts of cohesin were incubated with recombinant GST-Plk1, and the amount of phosphorylation was quantified by 32P incorporation followed by SDS-PAGE, silver staining (top) and Phosphorimager analysis, and quantification using the software program ImageJ.\n\n(B and C) In vitro-translated, 35S-labeled SA2 tagged at the N terminus with 9xmyc was incubated in interphase Xenopus egg extracts, which were induced to enter mitosis at time point 0 min by addition of nondegradable cyclin B \u039490 and okadaic acid. Samples were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Phosphorimager analysis. The autoradiographs in (B) show phosphorylation site mutants and in (C) they show C-terminal deletion mutants (see Figure 1C). The slower-migrating band represents myc-SA2, whereas the faster-migrating band is presumably generated by translation initiation at an internal start codon.\n\nTo be able to address the physiological relevance of SA2 phosphorylation, we first had to determine whether cohesin complexes containing tagged SA2 behave normally in human cells. Immunofluorescence imaging of wild-type SA2-myc showed a localization pattern that is very similar to the pattern found for Scc1 [10,14,15,18]. SA2-myc was nuclear in interphase, and mainly present in a soluble form in the cytoplasm during mitosis (unpublished data). When we extracted mitotic cells to remove the soluble pool, we found a minor fraction bound to chromatin, and in prometaphase and metaphase, SA2-myc was enriched at centromeres as compared to chromosome arms (Figure 5A). Therefore, the tag in SA2 does not seem to interfere with the behavior of cohesin complexes containing SA2-myc.\n\nFigure 5 Phosphorylation of SA2 Is Required for Cohesin Dissociation from Chromosome Arms during Prometaphase\n(A) Logarithmically proliferating HeLa cells expressing SA2-WT-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc were extracted prior to fixation, and stained with myc antibodies. In the upper set of images, kinetochores were labeled with human CREST serum, and DNA was counterstained with DAPI. In the lower set of images, only SA2-myc staining is shown.\n\n(B) SA2-myc expression was induced by different amounts of doxycycline (Dox.), and cells were arrested in prometaphase by nocodazole (Noc.) treatment for 3 or 10 h. Cells were spun on glass slides, extracted by detergent, fixed, and processed for immunostaining as in (A). Scale bars 10 \u03bcm.\n\nWhen we analyzed the intracellular distribution of the SA2\u201312xA mutant by immunofluorescence microscopy, we found that this protein was also nuclear throughout interphase and that the nuclear signal could only partially be reduced by removing soluble cohesin complexes by preextraction (unpublished data), indicating that complexes containing SA2\u201312xA can associate with chromatin like wild-type cohesin. In stark contrast to wild-type SA2, however, SA2\u201312xA was not strongly enriched at centromeres of prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes, but instead was almost equally abundant on chromosome arms and on centromeres (Figure 5A). A very similar distribution of cohesin on chromosome arms and centromeres has been observed after depletion of Plk1 by RNA interference [18].\n\nThese observations indicate that phosphorylation of SA2 is not required for the loading of cohesin onto chromatin, but is essential for its dissociation from chromosome arms during early mitosis. However, it also remained possible that cohesin complexes containing SA2\u201312xA simply dissociated from chromosomes more slowly than wild-type complexes. To address this possibility, we analyzed cells in which prometaphase was prolonged by treatment with nocodazole. Under these conditions, complexes containing wild-type SA2 dissociated completely from chromosome arms within 3 h but remained at centromeres (Figure 5B), confirming earlier observations made for Scc1 [15,18]. In contrast, SA2\u201312xA could still be detected clearly on chromosome arms after 3 h and even after 10 h of nocodazole treatment (Figure 5B), excluding the possibility that the dissociation of cohesin complexes containing this mutant is simply slower than the dissociation of wild-type complexes.\n\nCohesin Complexes Containing Nonphosphorylatable SA2 Are Able to Establish Cohesion\nIt was also possible that the amino acid exchanges in SA2\u201312xA had rendered the protein nonfunctional, possibly resulting in the formation of complexes that bound chromatin nonspecifically and therefore did not dissociate from chromosomes in mitosis. Thus, we asked whether cohesin complexes containing SA2\u201312xA are able to establish sister chromatid cohesion. To answer this question, we again treated cells with nocodazole, which normally results in the loss of cohesion between chromosome arms but not at centromeres, resulting in the formation of X-shaped chromosomes with \u201copen arms\u201d that can be seen by chromosome spreading and Giemsa staining [18]. In this assay, chromosomes from most cells expressing wild-type SA2-myc showed the normal \u201copen arm\u201d phenotype (between 55% and 71%, depending on the cell line analyzed; Figure 6A). In contrast, only 10% of mitotic cells expressing SA2\u201312xA contained chromosomes whose arms had lost cohesion during the nocodazole arrest, whereas 87% had maintained cohesion between chromosome arms (Figure 6A). This result strongly indicates that the cohesin complexes that contain SA2\u201312xA and that remain on chromosome arms in prometaphase (see Figure 5B) are able to establish and maintain cohesion between sister chromatids.\n\nFigure 6 The Presence of SA2\u201312xA on Chromosome Arms Correlates with Cohesion between Sister Chromatid Arms\n(A) Cells were cultured in the absence or presence of different amounts of doxycycline as indicated. After arrest in nocodazole for 3 h, cells were fixed, spread on glass slides, and stained with Giemsa (photomicrographs, above). Single chromosomes (indicated by a box) are shown at higher magnification in the lower right corners. The number of cells with chromosome arms that had opened (arms open) or that were connected (arms closed) was scored as indicated (bar graphs, below). Scale bar 10 \u03bcm.\n\n(B) Whole-cell extracts were prepared from HeLa cells expressing SA2\u201312xA-myc after treatment with increasing amounts of doxycycline (0, 0.2, and 2.0 \u03bcg/ml). The ratio of exogenous SA2\u201312xA-myc to endogenous SA2 was visualized by immunoblotting with antibodies to SA2. The position of molecular weight markers is indicated on the right.\n\nFinally, to further confirm this hypothesis, we asked whether the ability of SA2\u201312xA-expressing cells to maintain arm cohesion during a nocodazole treatment depends on the amount of ectopic protein that is expressed. We therefore treated cells containing SA2\u201312xA transgenes with different doses of doxycycline and compared the levels of exogenous SA2 with the arm cohesion phenotype. The levels of mutant SA2-myc were well controlled by the amount of doxycycline used (Figure 6B), and there was a clear correlation between the amount of SA2\u201312xA and the number of cells whose chromosomes maintained arm cohesion during treatment with nocodazole, whereas expression of wild-type SA2-myc had no significant influence on arm cohesion (Figure 6A). Cells of the SA2\u201312xA cell line maintained arm cohesion slightly more frequently than control cells even if SA2\u201312xA expression was not induced, but it is possible that small amounts of the ectopic protein are also synthesized in the absence of doxycycline.\n\nThese observations rule out the possibility that the different frequencies with which arm cohesion is observed after nocodazole treatment in SA2\u201312xA and control cells are due to other differences in the cell lines than expression of the different transgenes. We therefore conclude that cohesin complexes containing SA2\u201312xA are able to maintain and establish cohesion, but that these complexes are unable to dissociate from chromosomes during prophase and prometaphase. Phosphorylation of SA2 at its C terminus therefore appears to be essential for the unloading of cohesin from chromosome arms during early mitosis.\n\nPhosphorylation of SA2 Is Required for Efficient Resolution of Sister Chromatids\nAlthough the major amount of human cohesin dissociates from chromosomes during early mitosis, the physiological importance of this process is still unknown. One reasonable assumption is that cohesin dissociation might be required for binding of condensin complexes and for condensation of chromatin. Like cohesin, condensin complexes contain subunits that are members of the Smc and kleisin protein families [28,29,30], and cohesin dissociation and condensin binding normally coincide in cells [3,13]. However, inhibition of cohesin dissociation by interfering with Plk1/Plx1 or Aurora-B function in human cells or Xenopus egg extracts did not affect the binding of condensin and the overall condensation of chromosomes [16,17,18,31]. In line with these results, we found that condensin binding, compaction, and shortening of chromosomes in a prolonged mitotic arrest was not detectably influenced by expression of SA2\u201312xA (Figure S3), further strengthening the notion that condensin binding does not require the phosphorylation-dependent dissociation of cohesin complexes from chromosome arms.\n\nExperiments in Xenopus egg extracts showed that in the absence of Plx1 and Aurora-B, chromosome arms on mitotic chromosomes remained very close to each other, i.e., the resolution of sister chromatid arms was impaired [17]. In these experiments, it was difficult to distinguish whether Plx1 and Aurora-B promoted sister chromatid resolution by inhibiting the dissociation of cohesin or by another, independent pathway. We therefore examined how chromosome structure is influenced by expression of nonphosphorylatable SA2. We noticed that sister chromatid arms often stayed in closer proximity in SA2\u201312xA-expressing cells than in controls (Figure 7A). When we measured the interchromatid distance during prometaphase and metaphase, we found a variation within the same cell line from around 0.4 to 1.1 \u03bcm between individual cells (Figure 7B). This variability is presumably caused by different periods of time that cells have spent in mitosis; i.e., cells in which the interchromatid distance was small might have spent shorter time in mitosis than those in which sister chromatids were more resolved. We also found that there was some variability between different cell lines (unpublished data). However, cells expressing wild-type SA2 did not show any prominent difference in the average interchromatid distance in the absence or presence of exogenous SA2, whereas the interchromatid distance was progressively shortened when SA2\u201312xA-myc was expressed in increasing amounts (Figure 7B).\n\nFigure 7 Phosphorylation of SA2 Is Required for Efficient Resolution of Sister Chromatid Arms during Prometaphase and Metaphase\n(A) HeLa cells expressing SA2-WT-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc were spread on glass slides and chromosomes were stained with Giemsa. Representative cells from SA2 WT-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc cell lines after induction with 2 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline are shown. Scale bar 10 \u03bcm.\n\n(B) HeLa cells were induced to express SA2-WT-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc by different amounts of doxycycline as indicated, and processed as in (A). More than 50 cells in prometaphase or metaphase were selected randomly from each sample. The distance between sister chromatids was determined for five chromosomes in each cell and averaged. Light gray bars indicate average values that have been measured in one or two cells, and darker gray bars indicate average values that have been measured in three or more cells. Diamonds indicate the average distance for all cells in a given sample.\n\n(C) Representative immunofluorescence image of normal anaphase in a cell expressing SA2\u201312xA-myc. The cell was not extracted prior to fixation, so the soluble pool of SA2\u201312xA-myc is revealed by myc-staining.\n\nSince resolution of sister chromatid arms happens progressively during prophase and prometaphase, a reduction in the average distance between sister chromatids might also be caused by shortening the time up to metaphase (therefore leaving cells less time to resolve sister chromatids). However, when we compared the percentage of different mitotic stages in SA2\u201312xA- versus wild-type SA2-expressing cells, we found no indication of a shortening of prometaphase (unpublished data). Phosphorylation of SA2 and dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms therefore appear to be required for the efficient resolution of sister chromatid arms.\n\nSA2 Phosphorylation Is Not Essential for Anaphase\nThe prolonged persistence of cohesin on chromosome arms and the closer proximity of sister chromatid arms might cause defects in anaphase, for example because larger amounts of cohesin cannot be cleaved efficiently enough, or because perturbance of chromosome structure might interfere with the separation of sister chromatids. However, we did not observe obvious anaphase defects in cells expressing nonphosphorylatable SA2. Furthermore, in all anaphases that we observed (n > 50), we found that SA2\u201312xA had completely disappeared from separating chromatids (Figures 7C and S3B). Scc1 cleavage products could be detected in cells expressing SA2\u201312xA (unpublished data), consistent with the interpretation that the loss of SA2\u201312xA-containing cohesin complexes from chromatids in anaphase is mediated by separase. These observations indicate that SA2 phosphorylation is required for the dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase, but that this dissociation process is not absolutely essential for the initiation of anaphase. These data also further support the notion that separase is able not only to cleave cohesin at centromeres but on chromosome arms as well [18].\n\nDiscussion\nIt has long been known that cohesin's Scc1 and Scc3/SA1/SA2 subunits are specifically phosphorylated in mitosis [2,5,14,16,19,32,33]. In budding yeast it has been shown that phosphorylation of Scc1 by Cdc5 enhances the cleavability of cohesin by separase [19,20]. In vertebrates, however, the functional significance of these modifications has remained unclear. The circumstantial evidence in vertebrate systems that has existed so far points to a role of cohesin phosphorylation in controlling the ability of cohesin to bind chromatin [2,16], not in modulating Scc1 cleavage by separase. It was also unclear whether Plk1, a kinase that is essential for cohesin dissociation from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase [16,17,18], regulates cohesin in early mitosis by directly phosphorylating Scc1 or SA2, or by modifying other proteins that might be required for cohesin unloading.\n\nOur analysis of mitotic cohesin regulation in human cells revealed distinct roles for the phosphorylation of Scc1 and SA2. Phosphorylation of human Scc1 enhances the cleavability of this protein by separase, at least at the second of Scc1's two cleavage sites (see Figure 2), and thereby shows that this mode of cohesin regulation is conserved from yeast to humans. Furthermore, our data imply that Scc1 phosphorylation is not required for the dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms (see Figure S2), again consistent with the situation in yeast where Scc1 is phosphorylated in mitosis [19], yet cohesin complexes do not dissociate from chromosomes until separase is activated [34,35].\n\nIn contrast to the data for Scc1, our results show that SA2 phosphorylation is essential for the dissociation of at least some cohesin complexes from chromosome arms (see Figure 5), but this modification does not seem to be necessary for the cleavage of cohesin complexes by separase (Figure 7C and unpublished data). Cells that express nonphosphorylatable versions of SA2 are unable to remove all cohesin complexes from their chromosome arms during prometaphase (see Figure 5A), even if mitosis is prolonged for many hours by treatment with spindle poisons (see Figure 5B); presumably as a consequence, cohesion between sister chromatid arms is not lost in these cells during prolonged prometaphase arrest (see Figure 6). These phenotypes are virtually identical to the cohesin and cohesion phenotypes of cells in which Plk1 has been depleted [18]. It has also been observed that Plk1 can phosphorylate Scc1 and SA2 in vitro, can thereby decrease the ability of cohesin to bind chromatin, and is required for the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of Scc1 and SA1/SA2 in Xenopus egg extracts [16]. Obviously none of these results can exclude the possibility that kinases other than Plk1 contribute to SA2 phosphorylation, nor the possibility that Plk1 may also have to phosphorylate proteins other than SA2 to allow cohesin dissociation, but the simplest interpretation of all the data is that Plk1 is essential for cohesin unloading because it is required for SA2 phosphorylation, which in turn is a prerequisite for cohesin dissociation.\n\nIt will be interesting to learn whether this type of regulation is restricted to human SA2, or whether it also applies to paralogs and orthologs of SA2. In addition to SA1 and SA2, a meiosis-specific paralog of the Scc3 family exists in mammals, called SA3 (or STAG3) [36]. Most of the phosphorylation sites that we identified in SA2 are conserved in SA1, whereas SA3 diverges from SA1 and SA2 mostly in its C-terminal sequence (unpublished data). This difference could have important implications for the regulation of meiosis I, where arm cohesion needs to be protected to allow the separation of homologous chromosomes in anaphase I (reviewed in [37]), and where chromosome arms do not separate even if cells are arrested by treatment with spindle poisons [38]. It is possible that the replacement of SA1/2 by SA3 renders meiotic cohesin complexes resistant to Plk1-dependent removal from chromosome arms, and thereby allows the maintenance of arm cohesion until separase is activated. Likewise it will be interesting to analyze whether Scc3 is phosphorylated in budding yeast, in which cohesin dissociation from chromosome arms in early mitosis has not been detected.\n\nHow Important Are Scc1 and SA2 Phosphorylation In Vivo?\nSomewhat unexpectedly, we found that expression of neither nonphosphorylatable Scc1 nor nonphosphorylatable SA2 blocked progression through mitosis. Although it remains formally possible that our experiments did not identify all mitosis-specific phosphorylation sites and that we therefore did not mutate all critical sites, we consider it more plausible to think that phosphorylation of these proteins is not absolutely essential for progression through mitosis, at least in transformed cultured cells. This notion is supported by the finding that cohesin can be removed from chromosomes (presumably by separase), even in cells in which Plk1 has been depleted and Aurora-B has been inhibited\u2014i.e., under conditions where the early mitotic dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms is inhibited [18]. The implication is that the early mitotic dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes is not absolutely essential for mitosis, because separase is able to cleave all cohesin complexes that reside on chromosomes at the metaphase-anaphase transition. In this respect, human cells therefore appear to be more similar to budding yeast than previously suspected, in that HeLa cells can also initiate anaphase without first having to remove cohesin from chromosome arms.\n\nLikewise, there are similarities between yeast and HeLa cells in the regulation of Scc1. In both systems, Scc1 phosphorylation enhances its cleavability by separase, but in neither case is this modification essential for viability (this study) [19]. An interesting hint to the possible function of Scc1 phosphorylation comes from the observation that budding yeast cells lacking the securin Pds1 are viable and are able to undergo anaphase, but this ability is dramatically decreased if phosphorylation sites in Scc1 are mutated [19]. Since securin not only inhibits separase but is also required for its activation, yeast cells lacking securin may not have enough separase activity to cleave cohesin if Scc1 is not phosphorylated. Phosphorylation of Scc1 might increase its affinity for separase, and this effect may simply enhance the fidelity of anaphase initiation. Securin is also not essential for viability in human cells, but in its absence the specific activity of separase is decreased [39]. It would be interesting to test whether human cells lacking securin require Scc1 phosphorylation for viability.\n\nSimilarly, it is possible that SA2 phosphorylation and the resulting dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes in early mitosis, albeit not being essential, increase the fidelity of chromosome segregation. It is also conceivable that removal of cohesin prior to cleavage is not important for mitosis but for the next interphase. Separase-dependent cohesin removal destroys the Scc1 subunit and thereby renders cohesin nonfunctional. In contrast, phosphorylation-dependent dissociation appears to leave cohesin intact and might thereby enable the rapid reloading of cohesin onto chromatin in telophase, i.e., without the necessity for new Scc1 transcription and translation, which is inhibited during mitosis.\n\nHow Does SA2 Phosphorylation Lead to Cohesin Dissociation?\nCohesin is bound to chromatin in an extremely stable manner ([8]; E.R. and J.M.P, unpublished data), and this may be related to the fact that Smc1, Smc3, and Scc1 form a ring-like complex, at least in budding yeast [40,41]. It has been proposed that this protein ring establishes cohesion by encircling the sister chromatid strands [40]. In this model, it is easy to imagine how cleavage of Scc1 releases cohesin from chromatin. However, Scc3 binds to Scc1 and is not required for formation of the ring-like complex, and it is therefore not immediately obvious how phosphorylation of SA2 could lead to dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes. One possibility is that SA2 phosphorylation induces a conformational change in cohesin that opens the ring. Bulk phosphorylation of SA2's C terminus, for example, might considerably change its surface charge, thereby affecting interactions between Scc1 and the Smc1/3 subunits. In its simplest form, this model would predict that SA2 phosphorylation is sufficient for opening of the cohesin ring and thus is sufficient for cohesin dissociation. However, in preliminary experiments, we have been unable to observe cohesin dissociation when we added purified active Plk1 to chromatin (I. Sumara and J.M.P, unpublished data), whereas the simultaneous addition of Plk1 and Xenopus egg extracts to chromatin did enable cohesin dissociation [16]. It is therefore also possible that phosphorylation of SA2 recruits cohesin unloading factors to chromatin (which in the above experiment might have been contributed by the Xenopus extract), which then somehow enable the dissociation of cohesin from chromosomes. In budding yeast and C. elegans, cohesin needs additional factors for its loading onto chromatin [42,43]. Cohesin might similarly need aid for unloading, at least in the absence of Scc1 cleavage. If such additional factors exist and interact with SA2, the cell lines we created might provide a means to isolate the relevant molecules by differential purification of cohesin complexes containing wild-type SA2 and SA2\u201312xA.\n\nIf SA2 phosphorylation results in cohesin unloading by somehow enabling the opening of the cohesin ring without its cleavage, it would be conceivable that this reaction is simply the reverse of the loading process, during which the cohesin ring presumably also has to be opened transiently [44]. However, a prediction of this model would be that SA2 phosphorylation would also be required for the loading of the cohesin complex, whereas we find that complexes containing nonphosphorylatable cohesin can efficiently associate with chromatin and even establish functional cohesion. It is therefore more plausible to hypothesize that SA2 phosphorylation is a modification that is specifically used to remove cohesin from chromosomes in early mitosis by enabling a reaction that is not simply the reverse of the loading reaction.\n\nWhich Cohesin Complexes Are Regulated by SA2 Phosphorylation?\nSA2 phosphorylation is required for the dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms, but it does not seem to affect the behavior of cohesin at centromeres. As a consequence, sister chromatid arms are resolved much farther from each other than centromeres during a normal prometaphase, and they can lose cohesion completely if prometaphase is prolonged, whereas cohesion at centromeres is protected. How is this regulation achieved? Recent work in fission yeast has shown that members of the Mei-S332 family of proteins [45] are required for the persistence of cohesin at centromeres in meiosis I [46,47,48,49]. These proteins, called shugoshins or Sgo1, are thought to protect centromeric cohesin in anaphase I from premature cleavage by separase, but they are also found at centromeres in mitotic Drosophila and budding yeast cells [49,50]. In an associated paper by McGuinness et al. [51], we show that an ortholog of Sgo1 is also required for the persistence of cohesin at centromeres and for the maintenance of sister chromatid cohesion during prometaphase in human cells. Remarkably, Sgo1-depleted cells do not show cohesion defects if a nonphosphorylatable form of SA2 is expressed. This observation implies that cohesin normally persists at centromeres because Sgo1 protects cohesin in this chromosomal domain from phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis it will be important to determine whether SA2 phosphorylation does occur at centromeres. Our identification of in vivo phosphorylation sites on SA2 may be an important prerequisite for achieving this goal, because it should enable the generation of phosphospecific antibodies. Likewise, it will be interesting to learn how Sgo1 prevents or antagonizes SA2 phosphorylation, and whether the same mechanism is able to protect centromeric cohesin from separase in meiosis I.\n\nPrevious work has highlighted the difference in the regulation of cohesin complexes between chromosome arms and centromeres [10,18], but several observations suggest that there may also be important differences among different populations of cohesin complexes on chromosome arms. When we compared Scc1 cleavage in cells expressing either wild-type or nonphosphorylatable SA2, we noticed that the levels of Scc1 cleavage products in the latter cells were only slightly increased, if at all (unpublished data). If all complexes containing nonphosphorylatable SA2 remained on chromosome arms until prometaphase, we would instead expect to see more Scc1 cleavage in cells containing these complexes than in cells containing wild-type SA2. Furthermore, we noticed that the immunofluorescence intensity of SA2\u201312xA-myc in interphase cells from which soluble cohesin complexes had been removed by preextraction was clearly higher than the intensity of SA2\u201312xA-myc on prometaphase and metaphase chromosomes, and in subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting experiments we found that a fraction of SA2\u201312xA still became soluble in nocodazole-arrested cells (unpublished data). We made similar observations in immunofluorescence experiments in which we analyzed the chromosome association of Scc1-myc in Plk1-depleted cells. Also in these cells, some cohesin still seemed to dissociate from chromosome arms, despite the depletion of Plk1 (T. Hirota and J.M.P, unpublished data). The observation that some cohesin complexes do dissociate from chromosome arms even if Plk1 is depleted or if these complexes contain nonphosphorylatable SA2, whereas others do not, cannot simply be explained by slow dissociation kinetics of cohesin under these conditions, because those complexes that persist on chromosome arms can still be found there after 10 h of prometaphase arrest (see Figure 5B). We therefore favor the hypothesis that there are, in fact, two distinct populations of cohesin on chromosome arms: one whose dissociation depends on Plk1 activity and SA2 phosphorylation, and one whose dissociation does not. Since the population of cohesin complexes whose dissociation depends on Plk1 and SA2 is able to establish cohesion (see Figure 6), it is possible that those complexes that seem to be able to dissociate without Plk1 and SA2 phosphorylation are bound to chromatin in a manner that does not establish cohesion. Such binding modes must exist, because cohesin rebinds to chromatin in telophase [3,13], i.e., long before sister chromatids have been generated by DNA replication. This speculative model makes important predictions, for example that cohesin dissociation from unreplicated DNA should not depend on SA2 phosphorylation; we will attempt to test this prediction in the future.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nCell lines and growth conditions\nHeLa cells expressing myc-tagged human Scc1 were described previously [15]. HeLa cells expressing mutated Scc1, wild-type SA2, or mutated SA2 were generated by transfecting HeLa tet-on cells (Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States) with the pTRE2-hygro vector (Clontech) containing the respective cDNA and a 9xmyc tag fused in frame. Hygromycin-resistant clones were selected by growth in medium containing 400 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin, and were tested for expression of the myc-tagged protein by immunoblotting after induction with 2 \u03bcg/ml doxycycline for 1\u20133 d. Untransfected HeLa cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.2 mM L-glutamine, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. For growth of stably transfected HeLa tet-on cells, the medium was supplemented with 200 \u03bcg/ml G418 and 100 \u03bcg/ml hygromycin. Hydroxyurea and nocodazole were used at concentrations of 2 mM and 330 nM, respectively.\n\ncDNA mutagenesis\nSerine or threonine residues in human Scc1 and SA2 were changed to alanine by mutation of the respective cDNAs using the Quick Change Site-Directed or Multi Site-Directed Mutagenesis kit (Stratagene, La Jolla, California, United States). Where the phosphorylated site could not be assigned to a certain residue within a peptide, we mutated all possible candidate sites to alanine residues. C-terminally truncated versions of SA2 were generated by PCR. For in vitro translation, cDNAs were cloned into pcDNA 3.1 (\u2212)/Myc-His A (Invitrogen) modified to contain a 9xmyc cassette. The expression of cDNAs as 35S-methionine- and 35S-cysteine-labeled proteins was performed using a coupled transcription-translation system in rabbit reticulocyte lysate (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States).\n\nAntibodies\nAntibodies specific to phosphorylated threonine were from Cell Signaling Technology (Beverly, Massachusetts, United States; #9381). To detect myc-tagged protein, we used either polyclonal, affinity-purified rabbit anti-myc antibody (Gramsch Laboratories, Schwabhausen, Germany; #CM-100), or monoclonal 9E10 mouse-anti-myc antibody [10]. Polyclonal antibodies to human Scc1, SA1, SA2, Smc1, Smc3, and Smc2 have been described [3,10,30]. Anti-INCENP peptide antibody was raised in rabbit, and the serum was affinity purified. The following peptide was used for immunization: TDQADGPREPPQSARRKRSYC. Human CREST serum was a kind gift of A. Kromminga (Institut f\u00fcr Immunologie, Pathologie und Molekularbiologie, Hamburg, Germany).\n\nProtein purification and fractionation\nEndogenous cohesin was purified from HeLa cell extracts by immunoprecipitation using purified SA2 peptide antibodies (antibody 447) crosslinked to Affi-Prep protein A beads (Bio-Rad, Hercules, California, United States) as described [3,16]. For mass spectrometric analysis, cohesin precipitates were first washed with IP buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 0.2% Nonidet P-40, 20 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 10% glycerol, 1 mM NaF, and 0.5 mM DTT) [3] supplemented with 400 mM NaCl, followed by a wash step with IP buffer not containing detergent. Cohesin was eluted from the antibody beads by addition of 1.5 bead volumes of 100 mM glycine (pH 2.2). The samples were titrated to pH 8.5 by addition of NH4HCO3 to a final concentration of 200 mM. Cohesin complexes containing myc-tagged subunits were immunopurified with rabbit anti-myc antibodies (Gramsch Laboratories, #CM-100) using similar conditions. Sucrose density gradient centrifugation was performed as described [15].\n\nMass spectrometry\nA volume of 100 \u03bcl of immunopurified cohesin (isolated from about 10 mg of total HeLa protein) was reduced with 1 \u03bcg of DTT for 1 h at 37 \u00b0C and alkylated with 5 \u03bcg of iodoacetamide for 30 min at room temperature in the dark. The proteins were digested in solution with one of the following proteases or combination of proteases: 200 ng of trypsin for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C, followed by addition of another 200 ng of trypsin and further incubation for 4 h at 37 \u00b0C; 400 ng of Glu-C for 8 h at 25 \u00b0C; 400 ng of trypsin overnight at 37 \u00b0C followed by 400 ng of Glu-C for 8 h at 25 \u00b0C; 400 ng of chymotrypsin or elastase for 4 h at 25 \u00b0C (all proteases were sequencing grade; Roche, Basel, Switzerland); or 300 ng of subtilisin (Fluka, from Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) for 30 min at 37 \u00b0C. Generated peptides (100-\u03bcl sample) were separated by reversed phase nano-HPLC (LC Packings, Sunnyvale, California, United States) and analyzed using an ion trap mass spectrometer (ThermoFinnigan, from Thermo Electric, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) as described by Mitulovic et al. [52]. All tandem mass spectra were searched against the human nonredundant protein database by using the SEQUEST program (ThermoFinnigan). Any phosphopeptide matched by computer searching algorithms was verified manually.\n\nIn vitro Scc1 cleavage assays\nIn vitro cleavage assays were performed as described [10] with the exception that for the assays in Figure 2A, in vitro-translated human wild-type or mutant Scc1-myc was used as substrate. To isolate human separase, purified polyclonal antibodies generated against recombinant human separase were used (kindly provided by I. Waizenegger). In some reactions human GST-Plk1 (16) was added in a concentration of approximately 50 ng/\u03bcl.\n\nSA2 electrophoretic mobility shift assays\n\nXenopus interphase egg extracts were supplemented with 1/20 volume of in vitro-translated 35S-labeled SA2, which had C-terminal deletions or mutations of phosphorylation sites. All SA2 constructs used in this assay lacked the 69 N-terminal amino acids, because the start codon was initially misassigned. Extracts were induced to enter mitosis by addition of cyclin B \u039490 and 1 \u03bcM okadaic acid as described in Sumara et al. [3]. Samples were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed by SDS-PAGE followed by Phosphorimager analysis (Storm, Amersham Biosciences, Little Chalfont, United Kingdom).\n\nIn vitro phosphorylation assay\nSA2-myc or SA2\u201312xA-myc containing cohesin complexes were purified by immunoprecipitation with affinity-purified rabbit anti-myc antibody (Gramsch Laboratories, # CM-100). Conditions of the in vitro phosphorylation assay have been described [26].\n\nMicroscopy\nFor immunofluorescence microscopy, cells were either grown on coverslips or spun onto glass slides using a Cytospin centrifuge (Shandon brand, available from Thermo Electric). Cells were extracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to fixation to remove the soluble pool of cohesin. Fixation, immunostaining, and image acquisition were performed as described [10]. Chromosome spreads followed by Giemsa staining were performed as described [31].\n\nQuantification of interchromatid distance\nOn pictures of chromosome spreads, a line scan was performed across chromosome arms orthogonal to the long axis of the chromosome using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States). On the line scan, the distance from peak to peak was measured. Five chromosomes were thus analyzed per cell, and the resulting distances were averaged. More than 50 cells were randomly picked per cell line, and thus analyzed.\n\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Phosphorylation Sites in Human Scc1 and SA2\nSites for Scc1 (A) and SA2 (B) are shown. The sites marked in red and blue were found to be phosphorylated in mitosis by mass spectrometry. Residues marked in red were unambiguously identified, whereas in the regions marked in blue the phosphorylated residue could not be assigned with certainty. The separase recognition sites on human Scc1 (A) are indicated in green. Peptides identified by mass spectrometry are highlighted in yellow.

It is mediated by a multisubunit complex called cohesin. In yeast, proteolytic cleavage of cohesin's \u03b1 kleisin subunit at the onset of anaphase removes cohesin from both centromeres and chromosome arms and thus triggers sister chromatid separation. In animal cells, most cohesin is removed from chromosome arms during prophase via a separase-independent pathway involving phosphorylation of its Scc3-SA1/2 subunits. Cohesin at centromeres is refractory to this process and persists until metaphase, whereupon its \u03b1 kleisin subunit is cleaved by separase, which is thought to trigger anaphase. What protects centromeric cohesin from the prophase pathway? Potential candidates are proteins, known as shugoshins, that are homologous to Drosophila MEI-S332 and yeast Sgo1 proteins, which prevent removal of meiotic cohesin complexes from centromeres at the first meiotic division. A vertebrate shugoshin-like protein associates with centromeres during prophase and disappears at the onset of anaphase. Its depletion by RNA interference causes HeLa cells to arrest in mitosis. Most chromosomes bi-orient on a metaphase plate, but precocious loss of centromeric cohesin from chromosomes is accompanied by loss of all sister chromatid cohesion, the departure of individual chromatids from the metaphase plate, and a permanent cell cycle arrest, presumably due to activation of the spindle checkpoint. Remarkably, expression of a version of Scc3-SA2 whose mitotic phosphorylation sites have been mutated to alanine alleviates the precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion and the mitotic arrest of cells lacking shugoshin. These data suggest that shugoshin prevents phosphorylation of cohesin's Scc3-SA2 subunit at centromeres during mitosis. This ensures that cohesin persists at centromeres until activation of separase causes cleavage of its \u03b1 kleisin subunit. Centromeric cohesion is one of the hallmarks of mitotic chromosomes. Our results imply that it is not an intrinsically stable property, because it can easily be destroyed by mitotic kinases, which are kept in check by shugoshin.\n\nShugoshin helps to keep newly replicated chromosomes together by protecting cohesins from phosphorylation, until the moment for the chromosomes to separate has arrived\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nCohesion between sister chromatids ensures that traction of sister chromatids towards opposite poles (known as bi-orientation) generates a tug-of-war between microtubules attempting to pull sisters apart and cohesion between them resisting this. The resulting tension is thought to stabilize the attachment of kinetochores to microtubules [1]. Only when all chromosomes have come under tension and have congressed to the metaphase plate do cells destroy the connection holding sister chromatids together, which triggers the simultaneous disjunction of all sister chromatid pairs and traction of sister chromatids to opposite poles of the cell, known as anaphase.\n\nSister chromatid cohesion depends on a multisubunit complex called cohesin, which is composed of a heterodimer of Smc1 and Smc3 proteins associated with an \u03b1 kleisin protein called Scc1 [2,3], that is in turn associated with either SA1 or SA2 variants of the Scc3 protein. These proteins create a gigantic ring structure within which DNA molecules might be entrapped [4,5]. Sister chromatid cohesion is destroyed at the metaphase-to-anaphase transition because of cleavage of cohesin's \u03b1 kleisin (Scc1/Rad21) subunit by a protease called separase [6], whose activity causes cohesin to dissociate from chromatin. For most of the cell cycle, separase activity is inhibited by its phosphorylation by the Cdk1 kinase [7] and by the binding of an inhibitory chaperone called securin [8,9,10]. Separase is eventually activated by proteolysis of the Cdk1 cyclin B subunit and securin, both mediated by a ubiquitin protein ligase called the anaphase-promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) [11,12]. Because of the production by unattached kinetochores of an inhibitory form of the Mad2 protein, which binds an essential APC/C cofactor called Cdc20, the APC/C destroys securin and cyclin B only when all chromosomes have successfully bi-oriented [13]. This surveillance mechanism is known as the mitotic spindle checkpoint. Cells lacking any one of cohesin's four subunits fail to bi-orient chromosomes properly and arrest at least transiently in a mitotic state because of inhibition of APC/C-Cdc20 by Mad2 [14,15].\n\nIn yeast, cohesin persists at centromeres and along chromosome arms until the onset of anaphase, whereupon it is removed by the APC/C-separase pathway [8]. In animal cells, however, the bulk of cohesin associated with chromatin during G2 dissociates from chromosome arms but not from centromeres during prophase and prometaphase [16]. This so-called \u201cprophase pathway\u201d is thought to be driven not by cleavage of cohesin's \u03b1 kleisin subunit but instead by hyperphosphorylation of Scc3-SA subunits [17] mediated (directly or indirectly) by the Aurora B [18] and Plk1 mitotic kinases [19]. Crucially, expression of an Scc3-SA2 subunit whose serine and threonine residues phosphorylated during mitosis have been mutated to alanine reduces the dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms, which, as a consequence, remain more tightly associated [17]. Surprisingly, this mutation does not dramatically interfere with mitosis, presumably because the extra cohesin associated with metaphase chromosomes is efficiently removed by separase upon activation of the APC/C. The function of the prophase pathway is therefore unclear. Centromeric cohesin is not just more slowly removed by the prophase pathway because cohesin remains at centromeres during the prolonged mitotic arrest that is caused by activation of the spindle checkpoint. Under these circumstances, cohesion between chromosome arms is lost entirely, while that between sister centromeres persists [20]. Centromere-specific factors presumably protect cohesin from the prophase pathway.\n\nAn analogous process occurs during meiosis, during which cohesin along chromosome arms must be treated differently from cohesin at centromeres. Because of recombination between maternal and paternal chromatids, cohesin along chromosome arms holds homologous centromeres together and enables their bi-orientation. Cleavage of cohesin's \u03b1 kleisin subunit by separase along chromosome arms destroys this connection and thereby triggers the first meiotic division [21,22]. However, cohesin at centromeres is refractory to separase during meiosis I and therefore persists until metaphase II, and these cohesin complexes are crucial for the bi-orientation of sister chromatids during the second meiotic division. Recent work has shown that a class of proteins associated with meiotic centromeres, called MEI-S332 in Drosophila melanogaster [23] but now known as shugoshins, are essential for cohesin's ability to persist at centromeres after anaphase I. Shugoshin protects cohesin from separase during meiosis I in yeast [24,25,26]. Surprisingly, shugoshins are also found at centromeres during mitosis in yeast [24,27] and D. melanogaster [28]. This observation raises the possibility that shugoshins might have an important, albeit different, function during mitosis.\n\nWe show here that a human shugoshin that is possibly orthologous to fly MEI-S332 and yeast Sgo1 proteins [24,25,26] associates with centromeres during prophase and disappears at the onset of anaphase in mitotic tissue culture cells. HeLa cells whose shugoshin has been depleted by RNA interference (RNAi) fail to retain cohesin at centromeres during mitosis, and, as a consequence, their sister chromatids separate asynchronously before anaphase can be initiated, which triggers a prolonged mitotic arrest. Remarkably, expression of nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 alleviates both the precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion and the mitotic arrest. This suggests that centromeric shugoshin prevents phosphorylation of cohesin's Scc3-SA2 subunit and thereby protects the cohesion between sister centromeres that is essential for mitosis.\n\nResults\nThe Sgo1/MEI-S332 Protein Accumulates at Centromeres as Cells Enter Mitosis but Disappears during Anaphase\nThe human and mouse genomes each contain a single gene (hsSgo1 and mmSgo1, respectively) that encodes proteins with a similar structure and weak homology to fungal Sgo1 proteins and MEI-S332 from D. melanogaster. Analysis of cDNAs from various databases as well as RT-PCR products from mRNA obtained from HeLa cells and mouse testis suggest that variable splicing may give rise to several types of protein (Figure S1). To detect these proteins, we raised two antibodies against peptides from the N and C termini that are common to all human splice variants.\n\nTo evaluate the specificity of affinity-purified antibodies, we tested whether immunofluorescence signals or bands on Western blots were abolished when Sgo1 mRNA was depleted by transfecting cells with small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Figure 1). Because most subsequent experiments addressed Sgo1's role during mitosis, siRNA transfection in HeLa cells was combined with a double thymidine block and release to synchronise cells (Figure 1A). Cells were transfected with siRNAs 8 h after release from the first thymidine block, and 4 h later a second block was imposed by repeat addition of thymidine. After a further 12 h, cells were released from the second block and samples taken at specific times thereafter. Under these circumstances, most cells complete S phase within 7 h of the second release and soon thereafter enter mitosis. Both affinity-purified antibodies detected a 72-kDa protein from a chromatin fraction that was depleted by treatment with an Sgo1-specific siRNA but not by a mock treatment (Figure 1B). This size is consistent with an approximately 60-kDa protein predicted from the longest of the cDNAs analysed.\n\nFigure 1 Centromeric Enrichment of Sgo1 in Mitosis\n(A) Schematic overview of cell synchronisation and transfection procedure.\n\n(B) Characterization of Sgo1 antibodies. Affinity-purified Sgo1 antibodies raised against two different regions of Sgo1 recognize the same 72-kDa protein by Western blotting. Synchronised HeLa cells were transfected with water (Mock) or Sgo1 siRNA. Cells were harvested 7 and 11 h after release from thymidine block, and chromatin fractions were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with antibodies 94 and 95. A major band at 72 kDa was detected by both antibodies, which disappeared or was greatly reduced upon Sgo1 knockdown. The blot was reprobed with HP-1\u03b2 antibody as a loading control.\n\n(C) Localisation of Sgo1. Cells were costained for Sgo1 with antibody 94 (shown in green), and with CREST antiserum (shown in red). DNA was counterstained with DAPI. Five different stages of mitosis are shown: (a) prophase, (b) prometaphase, (c) metaphase, (d) anaphase, and (e) telophase. Bar = 10 \u03bcm. (f) A single pair of CREST labelled kinetochores are enlarged, showing two adjacent Sgo1 foci as commonly observed for late stage metaphases. Bar = 1 \u03bcm.\n\n(D) In situ immunofluorescence of (a) mock-treated or (b) Sgo1 siRNA-transfected HeLa cells, demonstrating the disappearance of the Sgo1 signal following siRNA treatment. The latter shows the typical in situ appearance of an Sgo1-depletion arrested cell (see Figures 3 and 6). Sgo1 was stained with antibody 94 (shown in green), and CREST is shown in red. DNA was counterstained with DAPI.\n\nIn situ immunofluorescence of cycling HeLa cells suggested that Sgo1 accumulates at centromeres during mitosis (see Figure 1C). Very similar staining patterns were observed with antibodies against both peptides (Figure S2). The centromeric staining was eliminated in most cells by siRNA depletion (see Figure 1D). Only 16% of all mitotic cells remained positive for Sgo1 staining following siRNA treatment, compared to 99% in mock-treated cells. Sgo1 started to form foci on chromosomes as cells entered prophase (see Figure 1C, part a). During prometaphase, Sgo1 was concentrated, usually as a single focus, on the inner side of the twin (sister kinetochore) structures stained by a CREST (calcinosis, Raynaud's phenomenon, esophageal dysmotility, sclerodactyly, telangiectasias) antiserum (see Figures 1C, part b, and 2A) thought to detect the kinetochore proteins CENP-A/B or C, and Sgo1 overlapped with and covered a slightly larger area than Aurora B during prometaphase (Figure 2B). During metaphase, two Sgo1 foci overlapping with or adjacent to the two CREST signals were observed at many kinetochores (Figure 1C, part f). Centromere-associated Sgo1 was much less abundant during anaphase, but it could nevertheless still be faintly detected adjacent to kinetochores at the leading edge of chromatids (see Figure 1C, part d). No Sgo1 foci could be detected in telophase cells (see Figure 1C, part e). A similar pattern was observed after transfection with a gene expressing a Sgo1-GFP fusion protein (E. Watrin and J.-M. Peters, personal communication). The distribution of Sgo1 during mitosis in HeLa cells resembles that of MEI-S332, its presumptive orthologue in D. melanogaster [28].\n\nFigure 2 Immunofluorescent Staining of Chromosome Spreads from HeLa Cells\nChromosome spreads were stained for Sgo1 with antibody 94 (shown in green), and counterstained with (A) CREST antiserum (bar = 10 \u03bcm), and (B) antibody to Aurora B, (both shown in red). DNA was stained with DAPI (shown in blue). Enlarged views show a single Sgo1 focus located between two sister CREST dots (A), and overlapping with Aurora B focus (B). Bar = 1 \u03bcm [applies to images b\u2013d in (A) and (B)].\n\nSgo1 Is Required to Maintain Sister Chromatid Cohesion in Mitotic Cells\nTo address the function of Sgo1 in HeLa cells, we harvested cells at 2-h intervals after release from a double thymidine block and compared cells whose Sgo1 protein had been depleted by siRNA to mock-treated cells (see Figures 1A, 1B, and 3). Sgo1 depletion had little or no effect on the kinetics of S phase completion or on entry into mitosis (see Figure 3A and 3C). At each time point, chromosomes were spread on glass slides after methanol-acetic acid fixation, and stained with Giemsa. We first measured the fraction of chromosome spreads in a mitotic state, then measured the fraction of seven different categories of mitotic chromosomes amongst mitotic cells (see Figure 3A and 3B). In mock-treated cells, the fraction of mitotic spreads peaked 9 h after release and subsequently declined. The most frequent category at early time points was prophase (see Figure 3B, part a), and the most frequent category at 9 h was metaphase (see Figure 3B, part b). Early-anaphase cells (see Figure 3B, part c) were very rare, whereas telophase cells (see Figure 3B, part d) accumulated later than metaphase cells. Sister chromatids were either tightly associated as during metaphase or fully separated into two equal-sized clusters, as during anaphase or telophase.\n\nFigure 3 Sgo1 Depletion Causes Precocious Sister Separation and Mitotic Arrest\nSynchronised HeLa cells were transfected with Sgo1 siRNA or dH2O, harvested at 2-h intervals following release and examined by chromosome spreading and Giemsa staining. 100 cells were scored for mitotic index, and 100 mitotic cells were classified into seven categories based on chromosome configuration as exemplified in (B) for each time point.\n\n(A) The frequency of each category of mitotic cell is given as a percentage of total cell numbers, such that the sum of each column represents the mitotic index.\n\n(B) Representative pictures of seven categories of mitotic cells. Chromosome spreads: (a) prophase; (b) metaphase/metaphase-like; (c) anaphase; and (d) telophase. (e) Early phase of precocious sister disjunction. At this stage, sisters are beginning to separate and some or all presumptive sister pairs are still discernible. Arrowheads indicate chromosomes whose centromeric cohesion seems to be lost. (f) Later phases of sister chromatid separation. Sister pairs at this stage are no longer discernible, remnants of the metaphase plate are still visible, and sisters have not yet hypercondensed. (g) Scattered single chromatids. Sisters are completely separated and distributed randomly in relation to one another, individual chromatids are hypercondensed, giving a \u201ccurly\u201d appearance. Note that chromatid separation in normal anaphases (c) are different from precocious sister chromatid separation (e\u2013g), in that disjoined and paired chromatids coexist in the same cell.\n\n(C) A portion of the cells harvested for the analysis in Figure 3A and 3B were ethanol-fixed and their DNA content was analysed by flow cytometry.\n\nSgo1-depleted cells accumulated in mitosis with similar kinetics, but many failed subsequently to exit from a mitotic state, with the result that nearly 50% of the cells had accumulated in a mitotic state 15 h after release (see Figure 3A). FACS analysis showed that around half of the cells failed to undergo cytokinesis (see Figure 3C). Many Sgo1-depleted cells accumulated at least transiently with chromosomes in a metaphase-like state, but at all time points a large number accumulated with fully condensed or even hypercondensed chromatids that had separated from their sisters (see Figure 3B, part g). At 9 h, when the frequency of metaphase cells peaked in mock-treated cultures, we observed not only a high fraction of metaphase cells but an equally high fraction of spreads in which most sister chromatid pairs had disjoined but chromatids had not yet hypercondensed (see Figure 3B, part f). Although many sisters had separated in these cells, we could also detect remnants of a metaphase plate. We also detected a small fraction of spreads in which this abnormal separation of sister chromatids had only commenced\u2014namely, spreads in which sister chromatids were still aligned but much farther apart than during a normal metaphase (see Figure 3B, part e). These data suggest that Sgo1-depleted cells enter mitosis and align most chromosomes on a metaphase plate, but subsequently fail to undergo anaphase. They then disjoin their sister chromatids asynchronously and in a manner that is not accompanied by directed movement to opposite poles, and, finally, arrest for a prolonged period with hypercondensed, fully separated chromatids. Because the transfected siRNAs could, in principle, interfere with the RNAi machinery that might be necessary for centromeric sister chromatid cohesion [29], we tested whether other siRNAs produce a similar phenotype. Not one of 12 different siRNAs caused the rapid mitotic arrest with separated sister chromatids that is characteristic of cells treated with Sgo1 siRNAs (Figure S3).\n\nThe Kinetics of Sister Chromatid Separation in Sgo1-Depleted Cells\nTo analyse the consequences of Sgo1 depletion with greater temporal resolution, we filmed mock-treated and Sgo1-depleted HeLa cells that stably express histone H2B tagged with enhanced green-fluorescent protein (EGFP), which enabled us to observe the movement of individual chromosomes and chromatids (Figure 4). After mock treatment, all cells that entered mitosis subsequently underwent anaphase. The time from nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD) to anaphase onset was 33 \u00b1 9 min (average \u00b1 standard deviation) (n = 30). In Sgo1-depleted cells, 73% of cells that entered mitosis separated sister chromatids without undergoing anaphase. Although most chromosomes initially congressed to a metaphase plate, many were slow to do so and some never congressed at all (Figure 4A). Although 27% of mitotic cells underwent anaphase, we noticed most of these did so with lagging chromatids (unpublished data). The time from NEBD to the point at which the first sister chromatid was pulled out from the metaphase plate in Sgo1-depleted cells was 39 \u00b1 12 min (n = 60), which is only slightly longer than the time taken by mock-treated cells to commence anaphase or the time taken by the minority of Sgo1-depleted cells that underwent anaphase (34 \u00b1 7 min; n = 23). Cells that disjoined sister chromatids precociously remained in a mitotic state with condensed but fully separated chromatids for a prolonged period (6 h 20 min \u00b1 2 h 3 min) before chromatids decondensed or cells underwent apoptosis. Kinetochore movements in mock-treated and Sgo1-depleted cells were also compared by filming cells expressing a CENP-A protein fused to EGFP (Figure 4C). The results confirmed that most sister kinetochore pairs congressed to a metaphase plate before splitting precociously, which led to collapse of the metaphase plate. It also confirmed the congression defect of some sister kinetochore pairs (Figure 4C, arrows). Our data imply that the highly abnormal separation of sister chromatids seen in Sgo1-depleted cells occurs at around the same time as cells would normally undergo anaphase and not as soon as cells enter mitosis. This suggests that Sgo1 may be required not to build sister chromatid cohesion during S phase, but rather to maintain sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis, a period during which most cohesin is removed from chromosome arms. Our data also show that the abnormal sister chromatid separation of Sgo1-depleted cells is not merely a response to an extended mitotic arrest.\n\nFigure 4 Live Cell Analysis of Sgo1-Depleted Cells\n(A) Synchronised HeLa cells expressing EGFP-tagged histone H2B were transfected with Sgo1 siRNA or dH2O as in Figure 1A, and analysed with time-lapse confocal microscopy. Stacks of 12 different z-plane images were obtained every 5 min and projected images for several time points are shown. Note that several chromosomes failed to congress to the metaphase plate, which was followed by progressive sister chromatid separation over time. Typically, a pair of disjoining sister chromatids dissociated simultaneously from the metaphase plate towards opposite poles.\n\n(B) Summary of live cell analysis. Cells prepared as in (A) were examined by time-lapse immunofluorescence microscopy. Mitotic cells were aligned on the time axis according to NEBD as determined from the loss of a defined nuclear boundary. Time from NEBD to anaphase onset/sister chromatid separation (white portion of bars) and from this point to chromosome decondensation or apoptosis (grey portion of bars) was measured.\n\n(C) To follow centromere dynamics, cells expressing EGFP-CENP-A were either mock-treated or Sgo1 siRNA transfected. Images were obtained by time-lapse confocal microscopy. Note that in cells depleted of Sgo1, dots of paired GFP-CENP-A can be found in earlier unaligned chromosomes (arrows). Single dots progressively fell apart in later phases, resulting in collapse of metaphase plate (images in lower row).\n\nSgo1 Prevents Precocious Dissociation of Cohesin from Centromeres During Mitosis\nTo test if the abnormal separation of sister chromatids in Sgo1-depleted cells is accompanied by loss of cohesin from chromosomes, we depleted Sgo1 from synchronised HeLa cells that inducibly express a myc-tagged version of the Scc1 \u03b1 kleisin cohesin subunit (Figure 5) [16]. Cells were harvested 9.5 h after release from the second thymidine block when many had already entered mitosis. After mock treatment, Scc1-myc staining along chromosomes was detectable in two-thirds of mitotic cells, which were identified by being positive for histone H3 phosphorylation (Figure 5A and 5B). Scc1-myc was typically more abundant at centromeres in such cells. This centromere enrichment was more clearly detectable (Figure 5A) if cells had been incubated in the presence of the spindle poison nocodazole for 4 h prior to harvesting, a treatment that induces a prometaphase arrest during which cohesin is completely removed from chromosome arms. Sgo1 depletion greatly reduced the fraction of mitotic cells with chromosomal Scc1-myc staining, in both the presence and the absence of nocodazole (Figure 5A and 5B). Interestingly, we noticed that Scc1-myc was rarely if ever enriched at centromeres in the few mitotic Sgo1-depleted cells whose chromosomes were still associated with Scc1-myc (Figure 5C and 5D). Importantly, Sgo1 depletion did not reduce the amount of Scc1-myc associated with prophase chromosomes (Figure S4). These results are consistent with the notion that the loss of mitotic sister chromatid cohesion caused by Sgo1 depletion is due to dissociation of cohesin from centromeres before cells initiate anaphase.\n\nFigure 5 Sgo1 Is Required for Stable Association of Cohesin at Centromere\n(A) Synchronised HeLa cells that inducibly express Scc1-myc were transfected with control or Sgo1 siRNA and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy with or without 4-h treatment with nocodazole. Mitotic cells were spun down on glass slides and analysed for cohesin with antibodies to myc epitope (right photomicrographs). Cells were costained with P-H3 (left photomicrographs, red) to identify cells from prophase to metaphase. DNA was counterstained with DAPI (left photomicrographs, blue). Note that with Sgo1 RNAi, Scc1-myc was undetectable in the majority of P-H3 positive cells (arrows). Cells with myc staining are indicated as staining controls (asterisks). Bar = 10 \u03bcm.\n\n(B) Quantification of Scc1-myc staining. Approximately 200 cells with positive staining for P-H3 were assessed for Scc1-myc staining, which was classified as positive, reduced, or negative, as indicated.\n\n(C) Lack of centromere enrichment of cohesin in Sgo1-depleted cells. Mitotic cells were prepared as in (A), and the centromeric enrichment of Scc1-myc was analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy. Merged pictures of Scc1-myc (green) and CREST antigen (red) are shown. Approximately 200 cells were scored for each experiment. Bar = 5 \u03bcm.\n\n(D) Centromeric cohesin is not maintained in Sgo1-depleted cells. Mitotic cells were prepared and processed for immunofluorescence as in (C). Representative cells with various levels of Scc1-myc are shown. Note that centromeric staining of Scc1-myc emerges as the bulk of cohesin dissociates from chromosomes in controls (upper panels). However, in Sgo1 RNAi cells, centromeric enrichment is hardly seen at any stage of arm cohesin dissociation (lower photomicrographs). Bar = 10 \u03bcm.\n\nSgo1-Depleted Cells Arrest in a Prometaphase-Like State\nTo investigate whether the loss of cohesin from centromeres is due to precocious activation of separase, we used in situ immunofluorescence to assess cyclin B1 levels and localization of Mad2 in mock-treated and Sgo1-depleted cells 11 h after their release from the second thymidine block. In mock-treated cells, cyclin B1 was concentrated within the nuclei of prophase cells and on the mitotic spindles of all prometaphase and most metaphase cells, although also throughout their cytoplasm, and was absent from anaphase or telophase cells (Figure 6A). To quantitate this result, we classified mitotic cells into five categories based on DAPI (4\u2032,6\u2032-diamidino-2-phenylindole) staining and scored the fraction of each category that was positive for cyclin B1 (Figure 6B). In mock-treated cells, cyclin B1 was positive in all prometaphase cells, in about 70% of metaphase cells, and in no anaphase cells. This pattern reflects destruction of cyclin B1 shortly before the onset of anaphase. In Sgo1-depleted cells, cyclin B1 was positive in all prometaphase and most metaphase cells. It was also positive in the vast majority of cells that contained metaphase plates with some dispersed chromatids and in cells whose chromatids had largely dispersed from the metaphase plate (Figure 6B). This implies that cyclin B1 destruction never occurs in mitotic Sgo1-depleted cells. This is presumably due to continued activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint because the chromosomes of mitotic cells lacking Sgo1 always contained foci of Mad2 associated with their centromeres, which is normally seen only in prometaphase in mock-treated cells (Figure 6C and unpublished data). These data suggest that separase is not activated in Sgo1-depleted cells. Their loss of centromeric cohesin is therefore unlikely to be due to Scc1 cleavage.\n\nFigure 6 Sgo1-Depleted Cells Arrest in a Prometaphase-like State\n(A) Sgo1 depletion prevents destruction of cyclin B1. Synchronised HeLa cells mock-treated or transfected with Sgo1 siRNA were processed for immunofluorescence microscopy using cyclin B1 antibodies (green) and CREST sera (red) 11 h after release from the second thymidine block. DNA was visualized by DAPI staining (blue). In mock-treated cells, cyclin B1 staining in prophase (a) and in prometaphase (b) disappears as cells segregate their chromosomes upon anaphase entry (c). Sgo1-depleted cells which segregate chromosomes asynchronously and arrest in a mitotic state retain preanaphase levels of cyclin B1 (d\u2013e). Bar = 10 \u03bcm.\n\n(B) Mitotic cells shown in (A) were classified into five categories based on DAPI-labelled chromosome configuration, and scored for presence or absence of cyclin B1 staining. Black bars represent the frequency of each category, and red bars represent the percentage of cells that fall into each category and are positive for cyclin B1 staining.\n\n(C) Recruitment of Mad2 in cells depleted of Sgo1. Cells prepared as in (A) were stained with cyclin B1 antibody, and counterstained with Mad2 antibody (red) and DAPI to visualize DNA (blue). (a) Prometaphase mock-transfected cells show Mad2 staining at kinetochores, which is lost as the metaphase plate assembles and disappears before cells enter anaphase (unpublished data). (b) Sgo1-transfected cells which have prematurely segregated sisters remain positive for Mad2 kinetochore staining. Bar = 10 \u03bcm.\n\n(D) Aurora B remains at centromeres in Sgo1-depleted cells. Cells prepared as in (A) were stained with Aurora B antibody (green) and counterstained with CREST antiserum (red), and DAPI to visualize DNA (blue). In prometaphase (a) mock-transfected cells, Aurora B is found at centromeres before relocalizing to the central spindle as cells enter anaphase (b). In Sgo1 transfected cells that show precocious sister separation, Aurora B remains localized at centromeres (c).\n\nAnother event that normally occurs at the onset of anaphase is the disappearance of Aurora B from inner centromeres and its accumulation at the spindle midzone [30]. Aurora B does not dissociate from centromeres at any stage of the abnormal mitoses of Sgo1-depleted cells, as Aurora B was found adjacent to CREST staining not only in metaphase cells (unpublished data) but also in cells whose chromatids have dispersed from the metaphase plate (Figure 6D). A corollary of this finding is that cohesin is not required to maintain Aurora B at centromeres, contrary to a previous suggestion [15].\n\nNeither Plk1 Depletion nor Aurora B Inhibition Suppresses the Precocious Sister Separation in Sgo1-Depleted Cells\nRemoval of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase depends on the activity of mitotic kinases, including Plk1. Might this Plk1-dependent process in normal cells be prevented from attacking centromeric cohesin by Sgo1? To test this idea, we analysed whether synchronised cells depleted for both Sgo1 and Plk1 also lose sister chromatid cohesion when they enter and arrest in mitosis. Mock-treated, Plk1-depleted, Sgo1-depleted, and Sgo1- and Plk1-depleted cells were harvested at 7, 9, and 11 h after release from the thymidine block, and the state of spread chromosomes was analysed by Giemsa staining (as described in Figure 3). The mitotic index of mock-treated cells peaked at 9 h and declined by 11 h, but the mitotic indices of singly or doubly depleted cells continued to rise after 9 h, reaching around 50% by 11 h (Figure 7A). Plk1-depleted cells arrested with hypercondensed, rod-shaped chromosomes whose arms were more tightly associated than those of prometaphase or metaphase mock-treated cells (Figure 7B, part d), which is consistent with previous findings [20]. Sgo1 singly depleted cells arrested with separated chromatids, progressing via the same set of stages described in Figure 3B. Importantly, cells depleted for both Sgo1 and Plk1 also largely arrested with separated chromatids (Figure 7A). The morphology of these chromatids was, however, very different from those seen in Sgo1 singly depleted cells. Of those cells whose sister chromatids had been separated (i.e., those represented by the red bars in Figure 7A), 100% possessed short, curly (presumably coiled) separated chromatids by 11 h in a culture depleted of Sgo1 alone, as shown in Figure 7B, part b. In contrast, 80% of such cells that had been depleted for both Sgo1 and Plk1 possessed separated chromatids that were both longer and straighter, as shown in Figure 7B, part c. Only 12% possessed short, curly chromatids, while 8% possessed chromatids whose arms were still loosely associated with their sisters, as shown in Figure 7B, part a.\n\nFigure 7 Neither Plk Depletion nor Aurora B Inhibition Suppresses the Precocious Sister Separation Seen in Sgo1-Depleted Cells\n(A and B) Synchronised HeLa cells were mock-treated or transfected with the indicated combination of Sgo1 and Plk1 siRNA and harvested at the time shown following release from thymidine block. Chromosomes were then spread on glass slides and examined by Giemsa staining. As in Figure 3, the percentage of mitotic cells were calculated out of 200 cells, and mitotic chromosome spreads were then further classified into one of 10 categories (n = 200 mitotic spreads for each time point). (A) The frequency of each category of mitotic cell (see examples in Figures 3B and 7B) is given as a percentage of total cell numbers, such that the sum of each column represents the mitotic index. (B) In addition to the seven categories in Figure 3A and 3B, the following categories (illustrated in Figure 7B) were scored: (a) sister centromeres separated, arms still cohesed; (b) scattered chromatids, same as Figure 3B, part g; (c) sisters are separated and randomly distributed in relation to one another, but are not hypercondensed; and (d) sister chromatids are cohesed along their length, and rod-shaped chromosomes are hypercondensed, as is characteristically seen with Plk1 knockdown [20]. For simplicity, the categories illustrated in Figure 3B, part e and f, and Figure 7B, part a\u2013c, were combined into a single category representing premature sister separation (shown in red). In smaller pictures, bar = 10 \u03bcm; in enlarged portions, bar = 2 \u03bcm.\n\n(C and D) Synchronised HeLa cells were mock-treated or transfected as indicated. At 6 h after release from the second thymidine block, cells were treated with nocodazole with or without Aurora B inhibitor Hesperadin as indicated, and harvested at hourly intervals up to 3 h thereafter. Mitotic index and chromosome spreads were assessed as in (A). (C) The frequency of each category of mitotic cell (illustrated in Figures 3B and 7D) is given as a percentage of total cell numbers, such that the sum of each column represents the mitotic index. (D) The seven categories scored for Figure 3A and 3B were also scored for this experiment. (a) Scattered chromatids as in Figure 3B, part g; (b) early phase of precocious sister disjunction as in Figure 3B, part e. In addition the following categories (illustrated in Figure 7D) were also scored: (c) Chromosomes have begun to decondense prior to separation, and sister resolution is defective, characteristic of Hesperadin treatment. (d) Centromeres cohesed, and arms opened and hypercondensed, characteristic of nocodazole treatment.\n\nThe fact that treatment with Plk1 siRNA dramatically changed the morphology of separated chromatids in Sgo1-depleted cells confirms that both proteins had in fact been effectively depleted. Our data therefore imply (somewhat surprisingly) that Plk1 is not necessary for the precocious separation of sister chromatids induced by Sgo1 depletion. Interestingly, Sgo1 depletion permitted not only sister centromere separation but also that along chromosome arms in cells supposedly lacking Plk1. This raises the possibility that the tight cohesion between sister chromatid arms that persists in Plk1-depleted cells depends on Sgo1.\n\nAurora B kinase activity has also been implicated in the removal of cohesin from chromosome arms. To address whether this kinase is responsible for the precocious loss of sister centromere cohesion in Sgo1-depleted cells, we examined whether inhibition of Aurora B by the small molecule inhibitor Hesperadin can suppress their sister chromatid separation. Because Aurora B and its yeast equivalent Ipl1 are also required to prevent cell cycle arrest of cells with defective sister chromatid cohesion [31] or cells whose microtubules cannot generate centromeric tension [32,33], it was necessary to maintain Mad2 inhibition of APC/C activity by addition of nocodazole at the same time that Hesperadin was added, 6 h after they had been released from the thymidine block. The former delays by at least 3 h the exit from mitosis of Hesperadin-treated cells [32]. Chromosomes were spread and examined by Giemsa staining after harvesting mock-treated and Sgo1-depleted cells at 6, 7, 8, and 9 h after release (Figure 7C and 7D). Addition of nocodazole caused both mock-treated and Sgo1-depleted cells to accumulate in mitosis between 6 and 9 h after release, which was largely unaffected by Hesperadin addition. Importantly, Hesperadin had only a modest, if any, effect on the precocious separation of sister chromatids in Sgo1-depleted cells (Figure 7C and 7D).\n\nInterestingly, treatment with nocodazole had a clear effect on the arrangement of the separated sisters in Sgo1-depleted cells. By 9 h, up to 73% of mitotically arrested cells resembled the image shown in Figure 7D, part b, where single chromatids lie in the neighbourhood of their presumptive sisters. In the absence of nocodazole, less than 5% of cells fell into this category (Figure 3B, part e). This implies that when sister cohesion is prematurely lost as a result of Sgo1 depletion, spindle pulling forces are not required to separate sisters but they are required to produce the scattered chromatid effect seen in the previous experiments.\n\nWe conclude that Hesperadin cannot prevent the precocious separation of sister chromatids induced by Sgo1 depletion, at least when such cells are prevented from exiting mitosis by addition of nocodazole. In a very similar experiment in which nocodazole was omitted, Hesperadin did indeed reduce the number of mitotic cells whose sisters had separated precociously (unpublished data). We believe that this effect is probably a statistical artefact caused by the failure of Sgo1-depleted cells treated with Hesperadin to arrest in mitosis.\n\nThe Precocious Sister Separation and Mitotic Arrest of Sgo1-Depleted Cells Is Suppressed by a Nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2\nIn a related paper, Hauf et al. [17] describe the mitosis-specific phosphorylation of 12 serine or threonine residues clustered within the C-terminal domain of cohesin's Scc3-SA2 subunit. Remarkably, a large fraction of Scc3-SA2 protein in which all 12 residues have been mutated to alanine (Scc3-SA2 12xA), which is no longer phosphorylated during mitosis, persists on chromosome arms throughout mitosis and even does so when cells are arrested for prolonged periods in a prometaphase-like state due to nocodazole treatment. The persistence of Scc3-SA2 12xA on chromosomes under these circumstances prevents loss of cohesion between sister chromatid arms in nocodazole-arrested cells, but it does not obviously interfere with mitosis in cycling cells. This implies that phosphorylation of Scc3-SA2 may be largely, if not solely, responsible for the removal of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase.\n\nWe therefore analysed the effects of Sgo1 depletion in cell lines in which either wild-type SA2 or SA2 12xA protein (both tagged with nine myc epitopes) is expressed from a doxycycline-inducible promoter at levels (when induced) that are comparable to endogenous SA2 protein (see Figures 8A and S5). We conducted the experiments on cycling cells that had been treated with (or without) doxycycline for 72 h prior to transfection. Cells were then transfected either with water (mock) or with the Sgo1 siRNA and harvested 18 or 24 h later, and chromosome spreads were examined after Giemsa staining. In mock-transfected cultures, the frequency of mitotic cells remained constant (at around 4\u20135%) at 18 and 24 h, regardless of the presence or absence of doxycycline or whether wild-type or mutant protein was induced (Figure 8B). In Sgo1-depleted cells, the mitotic indices of cells expressing wild-type Scc3-SA2 myc increased to between 16% and 18% by 24 h; the mitotic index also increased to 14% in cells that expressed only very low levels of Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc in the absence of doxycycline. As expected, most sister chromatids had separated in both sets of these Sgo1-depleted cells. The low frequency of telophase cells suggests that these cells largely failed to undergo anaphase. Remarkably, induction of Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc with doxycycline suppressed the accumulation of mitotic cells caused by Sgo1 depletion. Moreover, only a few of the mitotic cells contained precociously separated sister chromatids, and significant numbers had clearly undergone anaphase and produced telophase cells (Figure 8B). Most metaphase cells possessed chromosomes whose sisters were cohesed at centromeres as well as along their arms. Thus, expression of nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 at physiological levels suppresses both the mitotic arrest and the precocious sister chromatid separation caused by Sgo1 depletion. This indicates that loss of cohesin from centromeres in Sgo1-depleted cells may be due to (hyper-) phosphorylation of Scc3-SA2 at centromeres.\n\nFigure 8 Expression of Nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 Suppresses Sgo1-Depletion Phenotype\n(A) Total cell extracts prepared from HeLa cells that, upon doxycycline treatment, inducibly express either a wild-type (SA2-wt) or nonphosphorylatable (SA2\u201312xA) myc-tagged version of Scc3-SA2 were resolved by SDS-PAGE and probed with anti-SA2 antibody. The lower band represents endogenous Scc3-SA2, the upper band, myc-tagged Scc3-SA2. The first lane contains total cell extract prepared from untagged HeLa cells.\n\n(B) Expression of nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 suppresses sister separation caused by Sgo1 depletion. Cycling HeLa cells carrying inducible myc-tagged versions of Scc3-SA2 were treated with (or without) doxycycline at 2 \u03bcg/ml for 72 h prior to and during transfection to induce expression, as indicated. Cells were harvested 18 h and 24 h post transfection, chromosomes were spread on glass slides and Giemsa-stained. As in Figure 7, the percentage of mitotic cells were calculated out of 200 cells, and mitotic chromosome spreads were then further classified into one of five categories (n = 200 mitotic spreads for each time point). The frequency of each category of mitotic cell (see examples in Figures 3B, 7B, and 7D) is given as a percentage of total cell numbers, such that the sum of each column represents the mitotic index.\n\n(C) Nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2-mediated suppression is still observed when combined with nocodazole arrest. The indicated treatments were repeated as outlined in (B) in the presence of nocodazole which was added to cultures 4 h posttransfection, i.e., 14 and 20 h prior to harvesting of cells. Samples were processed as in (B), with the addition of a sixth mitotic category.\n\n(D) Live cell analysis of Sgo1 depletion of nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 (SA2\u201312xA) expressing cells. To follow chromosome behaviour, cells stably expressing EGFP-H2B and inducibly expressing SA2\u201312xA were used. Expression of SA2\u201312xA was induced 72 h prior to transfection as in (B). Cells were transfected with Sgo1 siRNA as in Figure 1A and examined by time-lapse fluorescence microscopy. Significant number of cells exit mitosis by expressing nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2.\n\n(E) Nonphosphorylatable SA2 (SA2\u201312xA) is found at centromeres even in the absence of Sgo1. HeLa cells containing either the myc-tagged wild-type (a) or SA2\u201312xA (b) inducible transgene were either uninduced or induced as in (B) 72 h before transfection. Transfection of Sgo1 siRNA was performed prior to the second thymidine block as in Figure 1A. At 8.5 h after the release from early S phase, mitotic cells were spun down on glass slides and analysed for cohesin localisation by immunofluorescence microscopy using antibodies to the myc epitope (shown in green). Cells were costained with CREST antiserum to label kinetochores (shown in red) DNA was counterstained with DAPI (shown in blue).\n\n(F) Quantification of SA2-myc staining. Samples similar to those described in (E) were stained with myc and P-H3 antibodies (the latter to identify cells from prophase to metaphase). Approximately 200 P-H3-positive cells were assessed for SA2-myc staining, and the percentage of cells that were both P-H3- and SA2-myc-positive was plotted. We believe that the apparent drop in the number of SA2\u201312xA-myc positive cells observed with depletion of Sgo1 relative to mock transfection is a statistical artefact caused by the mitotic arrest and accumulation of those cells that did not express SA2\u201312xA-myc (\u223c30%) but that were depleted of Sgo1.\n\nIt is nevertheless possible that nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 suppresses a mitotic defect of Sgo1-depleted cells responsible for their cell cycle arrest, and as a consequence these cells might not have long enough to lose sister chromatid cohesion. To address this possibility, nocodazole was added to doxycycline-induced cells 4 h after transfection (i.e., 14 or 20 h prior to harvesting), which caused both mock-treated and Sgo1-depleted cells to accumulate in mitosis (Figure 8C). In the case of the culture in which Sgo1 had been depleted and wild-type SA2 myc protein induced, a large fraction of mitotic cells (31%) had separated sister chromatids without undergoing anaphase. This fraction was much lower (9%) when SA2 12xA-myc protein had been induced. Most Sgo1-depleted mitotic cells expressing SA2 12xA-myc contained intact arm, as well as centromere, sister chromatid cohesion (Figure 8C). We conclude that SA2 12xA-myc expression suppresses loss of sister chromatid cohesion in Sgo1-depleted cells even when cells have been arrested in mitosis for many hours.\n\nTo examine more carefully whether expression of nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 permits cells lacking Sgo1 to undergo anaphase, we created a new cell line that expressed histone H2B tagged with EGFP as well as doxycycline-inducible Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc. Sgo1 was depleted in induced and uninduced cells from the same cell line and the behaviour of chromosomes followed by time-lapse video microscopy (Figure 8D). Three types of mitoses were observed: those in which sister chromatid pairs first congressed to a metaphase plate but then lost cohesion before undergoing anaphase (precocious separation), those in which some chromosomes were slow to congress and failed to undergo anaphase but did not display mass sister separation, and those in which chromosomes congressed to a metaphase plate and then underwent what appeared to be a normal anaphase with unaltered kinetics. Only 23% of uninduced cells depleted for Sgo1 underwent anaphase, and 63% separated their chromatids precociously, while the rest had congression defects. Remarkably, induction of Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc increased the fraction of cells that underwent anaphase from 23% to 60% and reduced the fraction of cells that separated sisters precociously from 63% to 19%. These data suggest that expression of Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc enables cells to undergo anaphase in the absence of Sgo1.\n\nFinally, we addressed whether the loss of mitotic phosphorylation sites on Scc3-SA2 enables cohesin to persist at centromeres as well as along chromosome arms in mitotic Sgo1-depleted cells. To do this, we analysed mitotic chromosomes from Sgo1-depleted cells expressing either Scc3-SA2-myc or Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc. Wild-type SA2 myc-tagged protein was associated with chromosomes in very few cells, while nonphosphorylatable SA2 myc tagged protein was found along the axes of all chromosomes in nearly 40% of cells (Figure 8E and 8F). Crucially, Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc was associated with centromeres as well as chromosome arms. Preventing Scc3-SA2 phosphorylation therefore enables cohesin to persist at centromeres in mitotic cells lacking Sgo1 as well as on chromosome arms in otherwise wild-type mitotic cells. This suggests that the loss of cohesin from centromeres in Sgo1-depleted cells is due to mitosis-specific phosphorylation of SA2.\n\nDiscussion\nIt has long been recognized that cohesion between sister chromatids in the vicinity of centromeres has an especially important role during both meiosis and mitosis. Centromeric cohesion is special during meiosis because it completely resists destruction at the first meiotic division when dissolution of cohesion along chromosome arms triggers the resolution of chiasmata. It is special during mitosis because, unlike cohesion along chromosome arms, centromeric cohesion persists even when cells are arrested in mitosis for prolonged periods by spindle poisons. The work described in this paper suggests, somewhat surprisingly, that both of these special attributes of centromeric cohesion might be conferred by the same protein, namely Sgo1.\n\nRecent work suggests that, in both budding and fission yeast, Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesion at meiosis I by preventing cleavage of cohesin's \u03b1 kleisin subunit by separase. Surprisingly, both Sgo1 in S. cerevisiae and its probable orthologue in D. melanogaster MEI-S332 are associated with centromeres during mitosis as well as meiosis. We show here that a related protein in human cells concentrates at centromeres during mitosis and disappears from chromosomes during anaphase. Remarkably, depletion of human Sgo1 by RNAi prevents HeLa cells from completing mitosis. Though most chromosomes congress to a metaphase plate in Sgo1-depleted cells, cells never undergo anaphase and instead arrest for a prolonged period in a prometaphase-like state with high cyclin B1 levels. Our data suggest that this is caused by a catastrophic separation of sister chromatids at around the time cells should have normally undergone anaphase, and that this event occurs in the absence of APC/C activation or dissociation of Aurora B from centromeres. This precocious separation is accompanied by loss of cohesin from centromeres as well as chromosome arms and activation of the mitotic spindle checkpoint, as documented by persistent recruitment of Mad2 to kinetochores. Remarkably, expression of a version of cohesin's Scc3-SA2 subunit whose C-terminal domain can no longer be phosphorylated as cells enter mitosis (Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc) not only alleviates the precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion of Sgo1-depleted cells but also permits a large fraction of them to complete what appears, at least superficially, to be a normal mitosis.\n\nOur findings together with those described by Hauf et al. [17] suggest that phosphorylation of Scc3-SA2 normally triggers dissociation of most cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase, but is prevented from doing so at centromeres by Sgo1, which is more abundant at this location than it is along chromosome arms (Figure 9A). We suggest that in the absence of Sgo1, Scc3-SA2 is removed by the prophase pathway from centromeres as well as from chromosome arms and that this leads to the complete disjunction of sister chromatids before cells can initiate anaphase, which is meanwhile delayed by the mitotic checkpoint (Figure 9A).\n\nFigure 9 Model for Sgo1 Function during Mitosis\n(A) During an unperturbed mitosis (Wild Type), arm cohesin (red circles) is removed in a kinase-dependent manner during prophase/prometaphase. Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesin (brown circles) until the metaphase-anaphase transition. Once all chromosomes have successfully bi-oriented on the metaphase plate, Mad2 inhibition of the APC/C is relieved, allowing separase activation. Separase in turn removes cohesin remaining at centromeres through cleavage of the \u03b1 kleisin Scc1 subunit, allowing the cell to enter anaphase. In the absence of Sgo1 (Sgo1 Depletion), cohesin is removed from the chromosome arms and at the centromere during prophase/prometaphase before chromosomes have properly bi-oriented and been attached to their full complement of spindles. Thus, Mad2 activity continues to maintain the spindle checkpoint, causing cells to arrest for a prolonged period in a prometaphase-like state with separated sister chromatids. Expression of nonphosphorylatable Scc3-SA2 (Sgo1 Depletion + Cohesin containing SA2\u201312xA) prevents the prophase removal of cohesin both from arms and centromeres, thus allowing cells to proceed through an apparently normal anaphase even in the absence of Sgo1 activity.\n\n(B) The phosphorylation state of cohesin may be the result of a dynamic balance in which Sgo1 somehow functions to antagonize the activity of mitotic kinases, including Plk1 and Aurora B and, potentially, other as-yet unidentified kinases (Kinase X, Y). In this model, when the direction of the reaction is artificially sent towards the hyperphosphorylated state (following Sgo1 knockdown), cohesin efficiently dissociates from chromatin; when the opposite state is favoured (e.g., as a result of Plk1 depletion) cohesin remains tightly associated with chromatin.\n\nThe suppression of the mitotic arrest induced by Sgo1 depletion by Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc implies that it is the precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion and not the lack of some other function of Sgo1 that is largely responsible for the pathological mitotic arrest of Sgo1-depleted cells. Our findings demonstrate for the first time that Sgo1-like proteins promote sister chromatid cohesion by regulating the activity of cohesin. This is inconsistent with the suggestion that Sgo1/MEI-S332 proteins confer a form of sister chromatid cohesion during mitosis that is distinct from that conferred by cohesin [34,35].\n\nSalic et al. [35] have also shown very recently that Sgo1 is required to prevent precocious sister kinetochore splitting. The authors suggested that Sgo1 has an additional role in stabilizing microtubules attached to kinetochores. Their proposal, that a defect in this putative function is the primary cause of the mitotic arrest due to Sgo1 depletion, is inconsistent with our observations. In our view, the simplest, although by no means only, explanation for the mitotic arrest of Sgo1-depleted cells is that loss of sister chromatid cohesion eliminates the tension needed to stabilize the connection between microtubules and kinetochores, which in turn leads to unoccupied kinetochores that recruit Mad2 and generate a form of Mad2 that is capable of inhibiting the APC/C's destruction of securin and cyclin B. Nevertheless, our finding that 14% of Sgo1-depleted cells expressing SA2 12xA-myc had congression defects is consistent with the notion that Sgo1 might also function to regulate kinetochore-microtubule interactions.\n\nHow might Sgo1 regulate cohesin? One possibility is that Sgo1 enables cohesin to be refractory to the effects of Scc3-SA2 phosphorylation. If cohesin embraces chromatid fibres within its ring structure, then phosphorylation of Scc3-SA2's C-terminal tail might induce the cohesin ring to open, and this process might be blocked by Sgo1. Alternatively, Sgo1 might prevent cohesin's dissociation by blocking Scc3-SA2's phosphorylation in the first place or by recruiting a phosphatase that reverses its phosphorylation (Figure 9B). Antibodies capable of specifically detecting phosphorylated Scc3-SA2 would make it possible to distinguish the first from the second and third scenarios.\n\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the process against which Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesin does not involve separase-mediated Scc1 cleavage. First, Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc's ability to suppress cohesin's dissociation both from arms in wild-type cells and from centromeres in Sgo1-depleted cells suggests that these two phenomena have a common cause. If the former is separase-independent, then so, presumably, is the latter. Second, the persistence of cyclin B1 throughout the period during which centromeric cohesion is lost in Sgo1-depleted cells implies that the APC/C is not activated and separase must therefore remain associated with its inhibitor chaperone securin. Third, cells expressing Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc proliferate fairly normally, and their timely destruction of sister chromatid cohesion at the onset of anaphase presumably involves the activation of separase by the APC/C. If separase deregulation were responsible for cohesin's precocious disappearance from centromeres in Sgo1-depleted cells, then Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc would have to suppress this defect by delaying Scc1 cleavage, which is difficult to reconcile with the timely onset of anaphase in cells expressing Scc3-SA2 12xA-myc. It is therefore likely that Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesin from different processes during mammalian mitosis and yeast meiosis, from chromosomal dissociation induced by Scc3-SA2 phosphorylation during mitosis, and from Rec8 or Scc1 cleavage during meiosis. Although different, both processes may have a key property in common, namely regulation by Plk1-mediated phosphorylation.\n\nIt is noteworthy that many shugoshins, including human Sgo1, disappear from centromeres during anaphase. This event might be triggered by their destruction at the hands of the APC/C along with securin and cyclin B [35]. This event might nevertheless assist in the dissolution of cohesion between sister centromeres at the onset of anaphase by exposing cohesin to the effects of its phosphorylation. Hyperphosphorylation of Scc3-SA2 might promote dissociation of cohesin complexes that had somehow evaded cleavage by separase, while hyperphosphorylation of Scc1 (which could also be triggered by Sgo1's departure) might actually facilitate Scc1's cleavage as occurs in both budding yeast [36] and human cells.\n\nThe identity of the mitotic kinases responsible for phosphorylation of Scc3-SA2 remains unclear. Because Plk1 is required for dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms in HeLa cells containing Sgo1 [20], it was surprising that Plk1's depletion did not suppress the precocious loss of cohesion caused by Sgo1 depletion. This finding indicates that protein kinases other than Plk1 can phosphorylate the C terminus of Scc3-SA2. Because Plk1 is necessary for dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms in the presence of Sgo1 [20] but not in its absence (Figure 7A), Sgo1 would appear to have a role in inhibiting dissociation of cohesin from chromosome arms as well as from centromeres. Though we could not detect Sgo1 associated with chromosome arms, modest amounts residing at this location might (at least partly) inhibit the prophase pathway. We suggest that Sgo1 antagonizes phosphorylation of Scc3-SA2 by several mitotic protein kinases, including Plk1 (Figure 9).\n\nOur study of human Sgo1 has hitherto been confined to HeLa cells. It will be important in the future to analyse its function in other cell types, especially in untransformed cells, and ultimately in real tissues from mice whose Sgo1 gene could be deleted by homologous recombination. It is curious, for example, that Sgo1's likely orthologue in D. melanogaster, MEI-S332, is not apparently essential for somatic cell divisions, which contrasts with Sgo1's essential function in HeLa cells. It is conceivable that small changes in the kinetics with which cohesin is dissociated from centromeres in Sgo1/MEI-S332-depleted cells is key to whether a cell is able to undergo anaphase before precocious loss of sister chromatid cohesion triggers the mitotic spindle checkpoint.\n\nOne of the most surprising implications of our work is that centromeric sister chromatid cohesion, which has long appeared to be a very stable state and to be the cornerstone (not to mention the most recognisable hallmark) of mitotic chromosomes, only exists because shugoshins protect centromeric cohesin from mitotic protein kinases that maraud mitotic chromosomes and threaten to destroy their integrity. This may have important implications for meiotic cells where protection of cohesin by Sgo1-like proteins (in this case, presumably from attack by separase) is essential for the second meiotic division. Chromosome mis-segregation during meiosis is responsible for trisomies such as Down's syndrome and possibly for age-related infertility and a large fraction of spontaneous abortions [37]. Our work raises the possibility that this could be caused by modest misregulation of protein kinases or phosphatases that affect the phosphorylation of centromeric cohesin. Whether Sgo1 protects centromeric cohesin from separase during meiosis I also by preventing cohesin's phosphorylation is an important question for the future.\n\nMaterials and Methods\n\nAntibodies\nTo generate rabbit anti-Sgo1 antibodies, we synthesized two peptides: one (for which the antibody was termed antibody 94) with the sequence YKEPTLASKLRRGDPFTDL (aa 474\u2013492) from the C terminus of a mouse cDNA (identical to corresponding peptide sequence in human protein) and a second (antibody 95) with the sequence QKRSFQDTLEDOKNRMKEKRNKN (aa 7\u201329) from the N terminus of a mouse cDNA (the corresponding sequence in human protein contains just four substitutions). Each peptide was conjugated with KLH and injected into rabbits. Sera were taken by a standard scheme, and specific antibodies were obtained by affinity purification using antigenic peptide-conjugated columns. For Western blotting, blots were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4 \u00b0C at a 1:500 dilution. For immunofluorescence, cells were incubated with the primary antibody overnight at 4 \u00b0C at a dilution of 1:100. Other antibodies used in this study were: mouse anti-Aurora B antibody (anti-AIM-1; BD Transduction Laboratories, San Diego, California, United States); CREST serum (gift from A. Kromminga, Hamburg, Germany); mouse anti-cyclin B1 antibody (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, United States; #GNS1); rabbit anti-Mad2 serum [38]; mouse anti-myc antibody (clone 4A6, Upstate Cell Signaling Solutions, Charlottesville, Virginia, United States); antibody to phosphohistone H3 (Ser10) [P-H3, a mouse monoclonal antibody that detects histone H3 when phosphorylated at serine 10 (Cell Signaling Technology, Beverly, Massachusetts, United States; #6G3)]; rat anti-HP-1\u03b2 (Serotec Laboratories, Oxford, United Kingdom; #MCA1946); and rabbit anti-SA2 (antibody 466; see [39]).\n\nCell culture, synchronisation, and transfection\nHeLa cells were cultured in DMEM supplemented with 10% FCS, 0.2 mM L-glutamine, 100 units/ml penicillin, and 100 \u03bcg/ml streptomycin. For synchronisation, HeLa cells were grown in the presence of 1 mM thymidine (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, United States) for 12 h, washed with PBS, and grown in fresh medium for 8 h. Cells were then transfected (see below) in serum-free medium (Opti-MEM, Gibco, San Diego, California, United States) supplemented with 0.3% FCS for 4 h, followed by addition of 1 mM thymidine and FCS to a final concentration of 20%. After a further 12 h, cells were again washed in PBS and transferred to fresh medium. Samples were harvested at various time points up to 15 h after the second release, as described below and in the figure legends. Nocodazole and Hesperadin were each used, as indicated, at a final concentration of 100 ng/ml and 100 nM, respectively. Doxycycline-inducible nonphosphorylatable SA2 HeLa cells were established as described in the accompanying paper [17]. For generation of EGFP-H2B stably expressing line, cells were transfected with plasmid encoding EGFP-H2B [40] using FuGene6 reagent (Roche, Basel, Switzerland), and stable expressants were selected in a complete medium containing 2.0 \u03bcg/ml blasticidin-S, and were screened by fluorescence microscopy for expression of EGFP-H2B. HeLa cells stably expressing EGFP-CENP-A were established and characterized as described [41]. For flow cytometric analysis, cells fixed in 70% ethanol were washed with PBS and subsequently stained in PI buffer [10 \u03bcg/ml propidium iodide, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 5 mM MgCl2, and 200 \u03bcg/ml RNase A] for 20 min at 37 \u00b0C.\n\nRNAi\nThe oligonucleotide sequence used to target human Sgo1 (oligo Sgo1.1A) was 5\u2032-CAGU\nAGAACCUGCU\nCAGAA-3\u2032. The oligonucleotide sequence used to target human Plk1 cDNA was 5\u2032-\nCGAGCUGCUUAAU\nGACGAG-3\u2032 [20]. Synthetic sense and antisense oligonucleotides were purchased from VBC Genomics (Vienna, Austria). For mock transfections, dH2O was used instead of siRNA. Transfection of siRNA duplexes was performed at a final concentration of 150 nM. Experiments performed with a second duplex targeted to a different region of human Sgo1 cDNA (oligo Sgo1.2B) yielded similar results. The oligonucleotide sequence of Sgo1.2B is 5\u2032-GGAUAU\nCACCAAUGUCUCC-3\u2032.\n\n\nPreparation of HeLa cell extracts\nTo prepare fractionated HeLa cell extract, cells were harvested by washing in ice-cold PBS and scraping from the plate. Cells were pelleted at 1,200 g for 3 min at 4 \u00b0C, and washed three times with ice-cold PBS. The cell pellet was resuspended in 200 \u03bcl of extraction buffer, which contained 150 mM NaCl, 10 mM NaF, 40 mM \u03b2-glycerophosphate, 20 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 2 mM MgCl2, 10 mM EDTA, 0.5% Triton X-100; 10 ml of this buffer was supplemented with one tablet of Complete Protease Inhibitor (Roche) and 1 mM PMSF. Cells were homogenized with ten strokes in a Dounce homogenizer and incubated on ice for 10 min, followed by another ten strokes. Nuclei and insoluble material were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000 g for 10 min at 4 \u00b0C. The supernatant was completely removed and denatured by addition of an appropriate volume of 4\u00d7 Laemmli buffer followed by boiling for 10 min at 95 \u00b0C. The pellet was resuspended in 4 volumes of 1\u00d7 Laemmli buffer, boiled at 95 \u00b0C for 10 min, and passed two times through a 27-gauge needle to shear DNA.\n\nImmunofluorescence microscopy\nFor immunostaining, cells were either cultured (and transfected where applicable) directly on glass coverslips, spun onto glass slides using a Cytospin centrifuge (Shandon brand, available from Thermo Electric, Waltham, Massachusetts, United States) for 5 min at 1,500 rpm, or spread on glass slides as described below. Cells were washed with PBS, (in the case of Scc1-myc and SA2-myc staining only, cells were preextracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 in PBS for 2 min followed by PBS wash for 2 min), and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Subsequently, cells were permeabilized with 0.2% Triton X-100 in PBS for 5 min. Cells were blocked in 3% BSA in PBS-T (0.01% Triton X-100) for 1 h prior to incubation with primary antibodies in the same blocking solution. Secondary antibodies were incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The following secondary antibodies conjugated to Alexa Fluor 488 and 568 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon, United States) were used: goat anti-rabbit, goat anti-mouse, and goat anti-human. DNA was stained by incubating cells in DAPI (1 \u03bcg/ml in PBS) for 10 min. Cells were mounted in Vectashield Mounting Medium (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, United States). Images were captured using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging, Downingtown, Pennsylvania, United States).\n\nChromosome spreads\nTo prepare chromosome spreads for Giemsa staining, cells were harvested by trypsinization and pretreated with hypotonic buffer containing 40% medium and 60% tap water for 5 min at room temperature. Cells were fixed with freshly made Carnoy's solution (75% methanol and 25% acetic acid), the fixative was changed three times, and the cells were then stored overnight at \u221220 \u00b0C. For spreading, cells in Carnoy's solution were dropped onto glass slides and dried at room temperature. Slides were stained with 5% Giemsa (Merck, Darmstadt, Germany) at pH 6.8 for 10 min, washed briefly in tap water, air-dried, and mounted with Entellan (Merck).\n\nChromosome spreads for immunostaining were prepared using the method previously described for spermatocyte spreads [42], as adapted for HeLa cells. Briefly, cells were treated with 330 nM nocodazole for 1 h, and mitotic cells were collected by shaking-off. Cells were incubated in a hypotonic buffer [30 mM Tris (pH 8.2), 50 mM sucrose, and 17 mM sodium citrate] for 7 min and then suspended in 100 mM sucrose (pH 8.2). A small volume of the cell suspension was put on a slide glass that had been dipped in fixative [1% paraformaldehyde, 5 mM sodium borate (pH 9.2), and 0.15% Triton X-100] and dispersed on the slide by continuous tilting. After extensive washing with PBS, lysed nuclei were dried and processed for immunofluorescence microscopy.\n\nLive cell imaging\nCells were grown and synchronised in Lab-Tek chambered cover glasses (Nunc, Roskilde, Denmark) and transfected with siRNA as described in Figure 1. At 6 h after the release from the second thymidine block, medium was changed to CO2-independent medium without phenol red, and the chambers were sealed with silicone grease. Three-dimensional image stacks of live cells were captured over time using either Zeiss 510 confocal microscope (Figure 4A and 4C; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) or Olympus BX51 fluorescence microscope (Figures 4B and 8D; Olympus, Tokyo, Japan).\n\nSupporting Information\nFigure S1 Cloning and Expression Analysis of hsSgo1 and mmSgo1\n(A) The expression pattern and primary structures of human and mouse Sgo1 (hsSgo1 and mmSgo1, respectively) transcription products were investigated. Total RNA from HeLa cells, mouse testis and mouse thymus were prepared using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, California, United States) according to the manufacturer's instructions. First-strand cDNA was synthesized by SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, California, United States) primed by an oligo dT primer, and PCR was performed using the Expand High Fidelity PCR system (Roche). For mmSgo1 cDNA amplification, we designed primers 5\u2032-\nCTGAGTGGCCGAGATGAATTTCAC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-\nTGTCCAAGAGACCCTCCTGATCAG-3\u2032 according to GenBank cDNA NM_028232.\n\n\nWe obtained two major bands at 0.9 and 1.8 kb [lane 1 (testis) and lane 2 (thymus)] and cloned them into the pGEM-T vector (Promega, Madison, Wisconsin, United States). Multiple clones were sequenced and PCR error-free sequences mmSgo1A and mmSgo1B were obtained. Note that when the secondary PCRs were done using the PCR reaction above as templates and primers 5\u2032-\nAATCTATGACCCACCTGCCTTAGC-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-\nGGTTCTGCCCATTGTGCACTGTCT-3\u2032, we saw three minor bands between 0.9 and 1.5 kb (unpublished data), suggesting multiple species of splicing variant.\n\n\nFor hsSgo1 cDNA cloning, we had found two potential splicing variants in the ENSEMBL database (BC001339 and BC017867) that have different 3\u2032 sequences. When primers 5\u2032-\nCTGGAGAGCTTCGAAGAGCCTTGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-\nCCTCTCCTGAAGCAACAGAAAGAG-3\u2032 (designed to amplify products from BC001339) were used, 0.9- and 1.0-kb bands were detected (lane 3), and hsSgo1A\u2013hsSgo1D cDNAs were obtained. When primers 5\u2032-\nCTGGAGAGCTTCGAAGAGCCTTGA-3\u2032 and 5\u2032-\nCTGAGTGAAACAGACTGTCAACAC-3\u2032 (designed to amplify products from BC017867) were used, six bands between 0.9 and 2.0 kb were detected (lane 4), and cDNA clones obtained from those bands were named hsSgo1E\u2013hsSgo1H and hsSgo1J\u2013hsSgo1L. We could not obtain a clone that encodes the identical open reading frame encoded by BC001339.\n\n\n(B) To examine the expression of Sgo1 in HeLa cells and various other human and mouse tissues, we performed Northern analysis. Total HeLa RNA was prepared as described in (A), and 20 \u03bcg was run on a formaldehyde agarose gel and RNA blots were prepared. A blot was probed with a [32P]-labelled probe (probe H1) generated against the common N terminus region of hsSgo1 [nucleotides (nt) 1\u2013647 of hsSgo1E). Many bands, although faint and ambiguous, were seen (lane 1). We could not assign each signal to a specific cloned cDNA variant; however, these data support the notion that many species of splicing variant are expressed in HeLa cells. When the blot was probed by another probe (probe H2) that is designed to hybridize to the central region specific for hsSgo1E and hsSgo1F cDNAs (nt 665\u20131454 of hsSgo1E), a signal at \u223c2.2 kb was seen (lane 2). Using two probes of hsSgo1, we could confirm that the two relatively long transcripts, hsSgo1E and hsSgo1F, that possess the central region, and the other shorter transcripts that lack the central region, are expressed in HeLa cells.\n\n(C) The tissue distribution of hsSgo1 mRNA was studied using a commercially available Multi Tissue Northern blot (BD Clontech, Palo Alto, California, United States). Multiple, relatively strong, signals were detected in testis, among other organs, on both blots probed by H1 and H2 (upper left blot and lower left blot, respectively). This higher expression of Sgo1 in testis might reflect the fact that testis contains a higher fraction of proliferating cells. Expression analysis of mouse Sgo1 was also performed in parallel. Both a probe against the common N-terminal region of mmSgo1 (probe M1, corresponding to nt 1\u2013610 of mmSgo1A) and an mmSgo1A-specific probe (probe M2, corresponding to nt 704\u20131339 of mmSgo1A) detected potential mmSgo1 messages in spleen and testis (upper right blot by probe M1, and lower right blot by probe M2, respectively). Mouse Sgo1 messages in spleen were more abundant than in testis, but human Sgo1 message was not detected in human spleen. The biological significance of the different levels of Sgo1 expression observed between human and mouse spleen is unclear. The tested polyA+ RNAs are from spleen (SP), thymus (TH), prostate (PR), testis (TE), ovary (OV), small intestine (SI), colon (CO), peripheral blood leukocyte (PL), heart (HE), brain (BR), lung (LU), liver (LI), skeletal muscle (SM) and kidney (KI). In conclusion, we cloned multiple splicing variants of hsSgo1s and mmSgo1s from HeLa cells and mouse organs. The presence of a variety of messages was also confirmed. However, the functional difference between and biological meaning of such variation remains unknown and requires further study.\n\n(D) Structures of cDNAs for hsSgo1A\u2013hsSgo1H and hsSgo1J\u2013hsSgo1L.\n\n(E) Predicted structures of proteins depicted as cDNAs in (D).\n\n(F) Structures of cDNAs for mmSgo1A and mmSgo1B.\n\n(G) Predicted structures of proteins depicted as cDNAs in (F).\n\n(2.7 MB EPS).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Figure S2 Sgo1 Antibody Characterisation\nIdentical Sgo1 localisation patterns were obtained by staining cells with two peptide antibodies raised against different regions of the protein (see Materials and Methods for details).\n\n(A) HeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were paraformaldehyde-fixed and costained with Sgo1 antibody 94 (directed against C-terminal peptide, shown in green) and CREST antiserum (shown in red) to label kinetochores.

Cells were harvested 11 h after the second thymidine release and analysed as described for Figure 3A and 3B. The histogram indicates the frequency of each observed category as a percentage of total cells, such that the sum of each column represents the mitotic index. The separated sisters category (represented by the red bars) combines the three categories illustrated in Figure 3B, part e\u2013g.\n\n(1.3 MB EPS).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Figure S4 No Reduction of Cohesin on Prophase Chromosomes in Sgo1-Depleted Cells\nHeLa cells expressing Scc1-myc were mock-treated or Sgo1 siRNA-transfected and harvested as described for Figure 5, cells spun down on glass slides, preextracted prior to fixation, and analysed by immunofluorescence microscopy using myc antibody. Cells were costained with P-H3. Prophase cells, identified by positive P-H3 staining with intact nuclear envelope, were measured for their fluorescence intensities of Scc1-myc and P-H3 using Image-J software. The ratio of fluorescence intensities of myc signals to P-H3 signals was calculated.\n\n(583 KB EPS).\n\nClick here for additional data file.\n\n Figure S5 Induction of SA2-myc Expression upon Doxycycline Treatment\nA sample of the cells from the experiment described in Figure 8B were spun onto glass slides and processed for immunofluorescence, staining with myc antibody as described (but cells were not preextracted with 0.1% Triton X-100 prior to fixation). In uninduced cells, a moderate level of leaky expression of the tagged protein is observed in a small number of cells (photomicrographs a, b, e, and f).

The costs associated with surveillance, diagnostic testing, and post-exposure treatment of humans exposed to rabies have fostered coordinated efforts to control rabies spread by distributing an oral rabies vaccine to wild raccoons. Authorities have tried to contain westward expansion of the epidemic front of raccoon-associated rabies via a vaccine corridor established in counties of eastern Ohio, western Pennsylvania, and West Virginia. Although sporadic cases of rabies have been identified in Ohio since oral rabies vaccine distribution in 1998, the first evidence of a significant breach in this vaccine corridor was not detected until 2004 in Lake County, Ohio. Herein, we forecast the spatial spread of rabies in Ohio from this breach using a stochastic spatial model that was first developed for exploratory data analysis in Connecticut and next used to successfully hind-cast wave-front dynamics of rabies spread across New York. The projections, based on expansion from the Lake County breach, are strongly affected by the spread of rabies by rare, but unpredictable long-distance translocation of rabid raccoons; rabies may traverse central Ohio at a rate 2.5-fold greater than previously analyzed wildlife epidemics. Using prior estimates of the impact of local heterogeneities on wave-front propagation and of the time lag between surveillance-based detection of an initial rabies case to full-blown epidemic, specific regions within the state are identified for vaccine delivery and expanded surveillance effort.\n\nA model predicting that the spread of rabies across Ohio will be much more rapid than elsewhere reveals the power of this approach to pro-actively assist targeted surveillance strategies and vaccine delivery\n==== Body\nIntroduction\nMajor recommendations from several Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and Institute of Medicine reports on emerging diseases underscore the importance of improving and developing new surveillance strategies to better inform interventions limiting the impact of novel and reemerging disease [1,2,3,4]. By using predictive models of spread we can position ourselves to target surveillance activities and prepare emergency response interventions tailored to the particular feature of an outbreak.\n\nRabies emergence in the eastern United States and Canada provides an excellent example of how predictive models can help guide surveillance and intervention strategies. Though long endemic in the southeastern U.S., raccoon rabies expanded rapidly along the eastern seaboard during the 1980s and 1990s from an initial focus along the West Virginia\u2013Virginia border; the initial focus was linked to the long-distance translocation (LDT) of rabid animals from Florida [5]. The particular variant of rabies virus associated with raccoons [6,7,8] has spread as a heterogeneous wave away from its original site of introduction and now extends as far north as Ontario [9] and as far west as eastern Ohio, Tennessee, and Alabama [10]. Understanding the context in which models of rabies spread were first developed requires a brief background explanation of the history of epidemic raccoon rabies and the methods used to control spread.\n\nSince late 1997\u2013early 1998, the westward expansion of rabies in raccoons has been curtailed through a massive program of oral rabies vaccine (ORV) delivery focused in eastern Ohio, and later expanded into adjacent border counties in Pennsylvania and West Virginia. Organized by the Ohio Departments of Health, Natural Resources, and Agriculture, in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Agriculture, the CDC, and Canadian agencies, a vaccine cordon sanitaire was constructed to keep raccoon rabies out of Ohio [11,12]; it also served the greater purpose of potentially preventing the raccoon variant's spread throughout the geographic range of raccoons, which, with minor exceptions in the southwest, includes the entire continental U.S. south of Alaska [13]. The campaign was successful, and through 2003, raccoon rabies in Ohio was limited to a few sporadic cases within the vaccine zone [10]. In 2004, this comforting streak of success came to an abrupt end.\n\nOn 21 July 2004, approximately 11 km beyond the western extent of the vaccine corridor, a rabid raccoon was detected in Leroy Township, Lake County, Ohio [14] (Figure 1). As of 12 August, at least ten additional rabid raccoons had been detected in Lake County and surrounding counties (Figure 1); given the delay of 3\u20134 mo between first detection of rabies and development of a full-blown epidemic [15,16,17], and the 40-km linear extent of this outbreak, we assume this is a new rabies focus with the potential to engender continued spread of raccoon rabies into Ohio and areas to the west.\n\nFigure 1 Spatial Location of All Positive Raccoon Rabies Cases in Eastern Ohio as of 11 August 2004\nEach sample is identified by number, date of collection, and the laboratory responsible for the positive identification (ODH indicates Ohio Department of Health). To date, more than 300 raccoons have been submitted to the CDC for testing. Ci, Cincinnati; Cl, Cleveland; Co, Columbus; T, Toledo; Y, Youngstown.\n\nVarious state agencies have already initiated a remedial wildlife vaccination program to limit further expansion of this epidemic. However, for strategic intervention purposes, determining the expected trajectory and velocity of rabies spread and estimating an effective zone for remedial vaccination would be invaluable [18]. In this paper, we use previously verified mathematical models for predicting rabies spatial dynamics to provide guidance on the likely trajectory and velocity of rabies spread from this emerging focus of infection and to identify specific areas for vaccine delivery and active surveillance.\n\nResults/Discussion\nThe Raccoon Rabies Epidemic\nWhen the expanding wave front of raccoon rabies reached the borders of Connecticut (CT) and New York (NY), county-level counts of animal rabies data were already being reported monthly to the CDC, as required for this nationally notifiable disease. Previously we analyzed time series data from the county-level data to make predictions about the temporal structure of recurring epidemics and estimated the lag time (approximately 3\u20134 mo) from detection of raccoon rabies to epizootic development [15,16]. In separate analyses, we arrived at similar estimates for surveillance delays [17]. The county-level data were suitable for assessing a general rate of front movement across the northeastern U.S. but not sufficiently resolved so as to provide information about local environmental heterogeneities that may alter rates of spread.\n\nConcurrent with the collection of county-level data, animal rabies cases occurring within individual townships were also collected by NY and CT state health departments, increasing the spatial resolution of disease reporting data 20-fold above that available from county-level reports. This increase in spatial resolution allowed for the construction of a detailed spatial model of rabies spread.\n\nThe Model\nThe data from NY and CT have been used to parameterize a stochastic spatial model for rabies spread among townships (Figure 2). The model was used for an exploratory data analysis to quantify the spatial dynamics across CT, and we found a 7-fold reduction in local transmission when geographic regions (i.e., townships) were separated by major rivers. In addition, the LDT of rabid animals was incorporated into the model to accommodate these rare, but significant events, often capable of engendering epizootics well in advance of the wave front when larger spatial domains were examined. The spatial model parameterized for CT was used to hind-cast the time to first appearance of raccoon rabies across NY townships using only knowledge of where the disease was introduced into the state and local heterogeneities that may influence the rates of spread [19]. The a priori CT model was able to predict the pattern of spread across NY, as well as provide an estimate of the possible effect of ORV intervention. Having demonstrated the predictive power of the spatial stochastic simulator for CT and NY, we can now use the model and our knowledge of the current outbreak to strategically forecast the spatial spread of rabies in Ohio.\n\nFigure 2 A Stochastic Model Was Used to Simulate the Heterogeneous Spread of Raccoon Rabies on an Irregular Network, Illustrated Here on a Simple Array\nAn infected township i infects its adjacent neighbor j at rate \u03bbij. In addition, township j may become infected because of translocation of rabid raccoons at rate \u03bcj. Heterogeneity was incorporated by allowing the local rate of infection from neighboring townships, and the rate of translocation, \u03bcj, to be different in different models. Each algorithm for associating a set of rates with rivers defines a stochastic candidate model.\n\nThe simulation algorithm involved six steps. (A) For each township, add the rates of infection from all possible routes of infection. (B) Add the townships rates to compute a total rate. (C) Draw a random number to determine the elapsed time. (D) Check to see if any forced townships have become infected in the elapsed interval. (E) If no edges were forced, select a random township to infect. (F) Infect the forced township, update the local rates, and repeat until each township becomes infected (after [17]).\n\nThe model transforms Ohio townships into a network; local spread of raccoon rabies among adjacent townships in the Ohio model was predicted where two townships shared at least one common point along their borders. An infected township i was assumed to infect its adjacent neighbor j at rate \u03bbij. In addition, long-distance dispersal of rabies was incorporated by assuming a low and constant rate of global infection \u03bcj for all uninfected townships regardless of spatial proximity to infected neighbors (Figure 2).\n\nIncorporating environmental heterogeneities into local rates of spread is crucial to predicting the local wave-front movement of terrestrial rabies. Rabies transmission was 7-fold lower when townships were separated by a river in CT, while in NY, the Adirondack mountain range was, and remains, an impenetrable barrier to the incursion of raccoon rabies. Ohio lacks the rough mountainous terrain of NY, but it has several major rivers that could influence westward expansion of raccoon rabies from a focus near the Pennsylvania or West Virginia border; five major Ohio rivers, the Miami, Muskingum, Scioto, Maumee, and Cuyahoga Rivers, were incorporated into our simulations (Figure 3).\n\nFigure 3 Satellite Image of Ohio Topography Illustrating Major River Systems and Location of Vaccine Corridor\nExtent and shape of the vaccine corridor is approximated. (Map reproduced with permission from Ohio Department of Natural Resources, Division of Geological Survey.)\n\nThe Ohio Forecast\nTransposing the model for use in Ohio merits a discussion of the geographic differences between CT, NY, and Ohio. In CT, the Connecticut River bisects the state, running north to south. The river's effect on the epidemic was maximized because the direction of epidemic spread ran orthogonal to the river, i.e., from west to east. Moreover, CT is much smaller than NY or Ohio. When the model was transposed into NY from CT, the townships in the Adirondack Mountains were excluded a priori because none of them had ever reported a case of raccoon rabies. The general triangular shape of NY and the exclusion of the Adirondack townships from the simulation, in conjunction with there being three initial foci within NY, left few townships far from any single initial focus. Thus, the successful hind-cast was based mostly on the relatively predictable local dynamics. In contrast, in Ohio we know of only one focus, in the northeastern quarter of the state, leaving many townships hundreds of kilometers from the epidemic focus. Given the greater distance between the epidemic focus and far reaching townships, LDT of infected individuals in Ohio could have a much more profound impact on the wave-front dynamics than was possible in NY or CT. Given the unpredictable nature of LDT events, we present two projections. In the first projection, we ignored LDT and focused on local rabies wave-front movement: \u03bbij = \u03b1 = 0.66 for townships not separated by a river; \u03bbij = \u03b2 = 0.12 for townships separated by a river; and \u03bc = 0. In the second projection, we used the exact parameters fitted to the CT epidemic: \u03bbij = \u03b1 = 0.66 for townships not separated by a river; \u03bbij = \u03b2 = 0.12 for townships separated by a river; and \u03bc = 0.0002.\n\nThe local-spread-only projection for Ohio assumed the rabies wave-front origin was from the townships nearest the center of the Lake County outbreak (case 3 in Figure 1), and the epidemic was simulated without LDT. As the local dynamics of rabies are fairly predictable, this could be considered the best-case scenario. Retaining the parameters for local spread from CT and disallowing any LDT, the rabies epidemic required 70 mo to reach the western corners of the state (Figure 4A). In the absence of LDT, the predicted rate of front propagation is faster than previously reported for other states because of the influence of the permissive zone of central Ohio, in which few environmental impediments exist.\n\nFigure 4 Predicted Trajectory of Rabies in Ohio Based on the Current Outbreak\n(A) Predicted time to first appearance (months) of raccoon rabies spreading from Chardon Township and surrounding townships given no vaccine intervention and with LDT excluded from model predictions. The time course of spread is revealed through the contour plot, where each color band indicates a given time interval to arrival at a township. The width of the bands corresponds to velocity of spread, with wider bands associated with more rapid spread. Major cities are Cleveland (Cl), Youngstown (Y), Toledo (T), Columbus (Co), and Cincinnati (Ci). The two black lines labeled A and B correspond to the area where cases have been detected (A) and the expected position of the wave front given a long-tailed distribution of incubation periods.\n\n(B) Predicted time to first appearance (months) of raccoon rabies spreading from Chardon Township and surrounding townships given no vaccine intervention and including estimates of long-distance dispersal modeled in CT and NY .\n\nThe projection with LDT was approximately one-third faster than the local-only spread, even with the very low levels of long-distance dispersal modeled. In these simulations rabies spread across central Ohio within 33 mo and covered the state by month 41 (Figure 4B). Passage across the midsection of Ohio was particularly fast; the estimate of 100 km/y far exceeds previous estimates for the rate of spread of raccoon rabies, which typically ranges between 30 and 60 km/y [20,21,22]. By our estimates, if unchecked, rabies will likely spread across Ohio in the same amount of time that it took rabies to transverse CT, even though Ohio is 2.1 times wider than CT. The potential for such rapid spread is quite alarming.\n\nAdding the possibility of global LDT to the model, even at the low rate assumed in the original model for CT, served as a massive promoter of rapid spread. This can be envisaged as the worst-case scenario, with LDT greatly increasing the rate of wave-front propagation across the state. Because of the largely unpredictable nature of LDT, it must be assumed that reality is likely to be somewhere in between the two modeled scenarios, but exactly where is difficult to discern.\n\nThe picture that emerges from both scenarios suggests that rabies will spread rapidly through the middle of Ohio, where there are few environmental impediments to disease front expansion. Rivers and mountains in Ohio do not constitute a major barrier to rabies spread. Similarly, rabies will not encounter any impediment like the Adirondack Mountains in NY. With no effective physical barrier across the middle of Ohio, rabies could move more rapidly through this zone then in any previously recorded epizootic.\n\nThe design of vaccine barriers to control the Lake County epidemic must allow for the distance the wave front will advance prior to detection of the first laboratory-confirmed case of raccoon variant rabies within a county. This parameter is unknown, although estimates of the delay from the first detected case of raccoon variant rabies to the start of the first epidemic exist [15,16,17,18]: the delay is approximately 3\u20134 mo. Thus, the detection of the first case of raccoon rabies in a township through passive surveillance indicates roughly where the front was 3\u20134 mo before.\n\nAs no other data exist to help assess the bias in lag between the arrival date of raccoon rabies and the date of detection recorded in the national surveillance database, we set the interval from arrival to detection at 3\u20134 mo. This parameter defines where to place the inner perimeter line A (Figure 4A). Few estimates of incubation time from natural field situations exist; however, Tinline et al. [18] provided some estimates on the distribution of incubation times for raccoons infected with their homologous variant. We used the 75th percentile in incubation time from Tinline et al. [18] to derive a confidence line for the expected wave-front advance (line B in Figure 4A), adding the incubation time to the calculations for line A; thus the area between perimeter lines A and B defines the vaccination corridor required to target susceptible animals (Figure 4A).\n\nStrategic Planning and Alternative Outbreak Scenarios\nAny intervention decisions or strategic plans based on model projections require that models deliver a robust outcome. We explored two additional scenarios for raccoon rabies emergence and spread through Ohio based on potential breach points in the vaccine corridor and consider the utility of the model for selecting sights for enhanced surveillance.\n\nAlternative scenario 1\nA breech in the cordon sanitaire could occur within a similar time frame as a LDT, and we considered the effects of independent and concomitant breeching and LDT events in a series of alternative scenarios. Adding such events to the spatial simulations significantly decreases the times to first appearance of raccoon rabies compared to that predicted solely on local spread. Modeling various LDT scenarios is warranted because LDTs occur frequently [23] and have demonstrably played a central role in the epizootiology of raccoon rabies, and are regarded herein and elsewhere as a critical element in our efforts to understand and model the epizootic dynamics of raccoon rabies.\n\nWe simulated the pattern of rabies spread associated with a breach in the vaccine corridor near Youngstown (near the current outbreak location) coupled with a forced LDT event into the Athens-Hocking landfill. The Athens-Hocking landfill is the landfill closest to the current front of raccoon rabies outside of Ohio that receives interstate refuse. The LDT event was incorporated into the computer simulation as an initial condition that occurred at month 12 during the simulated spread, in addition to base levels of LDT derived from CT (\u03bc = 0.0002). Spread from the landfill in conjunction with the advancing front originating near Youngstown generated two advancing fronts that converged in the middle of the state (Figure 5A).\n\nFigure 5 Combined Effects of LDT and a Break in the Vaccine Barrier on Pattern of Rabies Spread across Ohio\n(A) Predicted time to first appearance (months) of raccoon rabies given a breach of the cordon sanitaire near Youngstown and the LDT of an infected individual into the Athens-Hocking landfill at month 12.\n\n(B) Residual differences between simulations of the Youngstown breach with and without the forced LDT event at the Athens-Hocking landfill. The larger the red squares, the larger the residual difference between the simulations with and without the forced LDT.\n\nCi, Cincinnati; Cl, Cleveland; Co, Columbus; T, Toledo; Y, Youngstown.\n\nTo explore the overall impact of multiple introductions on the time to first appearance we compared simulations with and without the translocation event into the Athens-Hocking landfill. The forced LDT event caused rabies to reach the southern portion of Ohio far earlier than predicted in the absence of the forced LDT. However, the rivers seem to limit the overall additive effect on time of first appearance in western Ohio by acting as natural barriers to spread. There appears to be no additive effect on the rate of disease movement across the middle of the state associated with the union of the advancing wave fronts, as revealed in a plot of the residual differences between simulations (Figure 5B).\n\nAlternative scenario 2\nRabies has a variety of alternative paths of entry into Ohio from infected regions across the cordon sanitaire. In this scenario, we consider the spatial trajectories of rabies spread from a variety of single points of entry and compare these alternative trajectories to determine the most common areas of overlap and, hence, where rabies is most likely to emerge. For example, we consider the trajectory of spread given an introduction around Youngstown and compare this with an introduction around Bridgeport, Ohio (near Wheeling, West Virginia), that would be near the southern end of the vaccine corridor in Ohio.\n\nIt is reasonable to assume that the Ohio River serves as a barrier to raccoon movement, but there is the potential for rabid individuals to cross bridges into Ohio. Given an introduction at Bridgeport, Ohio (Figure 6), the model predicts that the initial westward expansion would be halted by the Muskingum River, while northward expansion would be rapid. Following a crossing of the Muskingum, the model predicts the same sort of rapid westward expansion seen in the first scenario.\n\nFigure 6 Combination of Predicted Time to First Appearance Projections from Youngstown Breach and Ohio River Breach Scenarios\nThick black line indicates the minimal distance between the two epidemic foci orthogonal to the temporal contours. Given the trajectories, the path corresponds to the most likely location where the waves will first collide.\n\nScenario comparison\nBy jointly considering the predictions from these introduction scenarios, we demonstrate the utility of our model in establishing sentinel points for surveillance. Figure 6 shows the model predictions for spread associated with a river crossing near the southern terminus of the cordon sanitaire overlaid with our projections for spread away from the Youngstown area introduction. From the combination of these two scenarios we see that the first point at which the two epidemic fronts are predicted to meet is not along the Ohio\u2013West Virginia border but further west towards the interior of the state. We can use this juxtaposition of the two trajectories to establish a minimum time path for the epidemic movement (Figure 6) and can suggest sentinel points for surveillance along this line in addition to the surveillance strategies already in place.\n\nThe three simulation sets\u2014the current outbreak (with LDT) and alternative scenarios 1 and 2\u2014can be compared to assess the sensitivity of rate estimation on at least these initial conditions. A plot of the maximum residual differences in time to first appearance between all three simulation sets suggests that the predicted velocity and overall trajectory of rabies spread are robust to changes in outbreak origin (Figure 7). Though large residuals exist between the three simulations around the introduction sites, a striking common feature of all simulation outcomes is the rapid spread of raccoon rabies across central Ohio given an average effect of LDT. Maximum differences in the estimated time to raccoon rabies arrival between simulations in central and western Ohio varied by less than 1 mo, irrespective of breach location in the ORV barrier.\n\nFigure 7 Residual Differences between Time to First Appearance from Simulated Epidemics Initiated by Breaches in Different Geographic Locations\nThe maximum difference between the predicted times to first appearance is indicated in each township by the size and color of the corresponding diamond. (A) represents an epidemic simulated from current outbreak data shown in Figure 1. (B) represents an epidemic simulated from the movement of an infected animal across the cordon sanitaire near Youngstown. (C) represents the introduction of an infected animal from West Virginia at a bridge across the Ohio River.\n\nConclusions\nExperience with parenteral rabies vaccination programs and ORV-based attempts to control wildlife rabies in the U.S. and Europe has demonstrated that all vaccine barriers are, to some extent, permeable and vulnerable to breaches [24,25,26]. Ohio has proven to be no exception.\n\nConsidering the vulnerabilities of any vaccine corridor, and the difficulties inherent in anticipating break sites in a vaccine barrier and identifying sites of LDT, the unlimited ability to explore scenarios by mathematical simulation and to compute and compare different design strategies for ORV interventions provide a valuable exercise to plan for real epidemics. From the simulations shown here, a robust pattern of trajectory, an extraordinarily high rate of spread of raccoon rabies through central Ohio, the significant potential impact of LDT, and lack of environmental impediments suggest that a strategy combining early detection and rapid intervention are requisite if control is to succeed. A robust intervention plan is invaluable, even if the exact site or sites to which it is applied prove elusive.\n\n\nThe approach discussed here reveals some of the many gaps in our knowledge of wildlife rabies and in the data available to inform initial conditions for simulations. Without a second measure of the arrival\u2013detection delay, obtained from an independent and extremely sensitive surveillance system (e.g., coupling active sampling of road-killed raccoons, purposeful hunter collections, and kill-trap data), we have no tools to calibrate detection times obtained through the passive national surveillance system.\n\nIn western Europe, reinforcement of natural barriers, such as rivers, lakes, and mountains, have been a staple in the successful campaign to control red fox rabies by vaccination [24]. In Massachusetts and NY, pre-existing natural (i.e., the Adirondacks) and artificial (i.e., the Cape Cod canal [27]) impediments to the free movement of raccoons, and, hence, raccoon rabies, were reinforced by vaccine distributions. Unfortunately for the remedial efforts to contain the Lake County focus in Ohio, the benefits derived from enhancement of natural barriers are not an option. With the exception of river systems in southeastern Ohio, such as the Muskingum (for topographic details see Figure 3), there are few natural barriers to augment ORV distribution in the Lake County region or in central Ohio, if required.\n\nAs reinforced natural barriers are not an option for rabies control in much of Ohio, the need for rapid remedial intervention by ORV and intensified, active surveillance to estimate the actual epidemic boundaries is immediate. Enhanced surveillance, perhaps by collection and rabies testing of road-killed raccoons, and stockpiling of ORV sufficient to establish a new ORV barrier in central Ohio, are prudent courses of action.\n\nIf the Lake County epidemic escapes beyond remedial intervention efforts, the fallback position demands rapid construction of a second cordon sanitaire spanning central Ohio, at a location dictated by the then current position of the epidemic. If the disease is not confined within Ohio, the limits to raccoon variant rabies spread are defined only by the geographic distribution of its host. Nothing short of these activities will contain a rapidly expanding and fast-moving epidemic of raccoon rabies, should ring vaccination and other regional efforts fail to eliminate the current focus around Lake County. The interventions described here would appear as inexpensive alternatives to the uncontrolled westward spread of rabies and the loss of the millions of dollars invested in what would become the vaccine equivalent of the Maginot Line.\n\nWe thank Dennis Slate and Anthony Montoney (U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] Animal and Plant Health Inspection Service) for their cooperation in this project and for the mapped data for current raccoon cases in Ohio.
